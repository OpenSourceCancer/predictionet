	Abstract = {SUMMARY: The GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin brings fast gene function prediction capabilities to the desktop. GeneMANIA identifies the most related genes to a query gene set using a guilt-by-association approach. The plugin uses over 800 networks from six organisms and each related gene is traceable to the source network used to make the prediction. Users may add their own interaction networks and expression profile data to complement or override the default data. Availability and Implementation: The GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin is implemented in Java and is freely available at http://www.genemania.org/plugin/.

@article{mostafavi2008genemania,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most successful computational approaches for protein function prediction integrate multiple genomics and proteomics data sources to make inferences about the function of unknown proteins. The most accurate of these algorithms have long running times, making them unsuitable for real-time protein function prediction in large genomes. As a result, the predictions of these algorithms are stored in static databases that can easily become outdated. We propose a new algorithm, GeneMANIA, that is as accurate as the leading methods, while capable of predicting protein function in real-time. RESULTS: We use a fast heuristic algorithm, derived from ridge regression, to integrate multiple functional association networks and predict gene function from a single process-specific network using label propagation. Our algorithm is efficient enough to be deployed on a modern webserver and is as accurate as, or more so than, the leading methods on the MouseFunc I benchmark and a new yeast function prediction benchmark; it is robust to redundant and irrelevant data and requires, on average, less than ten seconds of computation time on tasks from these benchmarks. CONCLUSION: GeneMANIA is fast enough to predict gene function on-the-fly while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. A prototype version of a GeneMANIA-based webserver is available at http://morrislab.med.utoronto.ca/prototype.},

@article{korkola2007identification,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, presenting with a wide range of histologic, clinical, and genetic features. Microarray technology has shown promise in predicting outcome in these patients. METHODS: We profiled 162 breast tumors using expression microarrays to stratify tumors based on gene expression. A subset of 55 tumors with extensive follow-up was used to identify gene sets that predicted outcome. The predictive gene set was further tested in previously published data sets. RESULTS: We used different statistical methods to identify three gene sets associated with disease free survival. A fourth gene set, consisting of 21 genes in common to all three sets, also had the ability to predict patient outcome. To validate the predictive utility of this derived gene set, it was tested in two published data sets from other groups. This gene set resulted in significant separation of patients on the basis of survival in these data sets, correctly predicting outcome in 62-65\% of patients. By comparing outcome prediction within subgroups based on ER status, grade, and nodal status, we found that our gene set was most effective in predicting outcome in ER positive and node negative tumors. CONCLUSION: This robust gene selection with extensive validation has identified a predictive gene set that may have clinical utility for outcome prediction in breast cancer patients.},

@article{korkola2003differentiation,
	Abstract = {Invasive lobular and ductal breast tumors have distinct histologies and clinical presentation. Other than altered expression of E-cadherin, little is known about the underlying biology that distinguishes the tumor subtypes. We used cDNA microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed between lobular and ductal tumors. Unsupervised clustering of tumors failed to distinguish between the two subtypes. Prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM) was able to predict tumor type with an accuracy of 93.7\%. Genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the two groups were identified by MaxT permutation analysis using t tests (20 cDNA clones and 10 unique genes), significance analysis for microarrays (33 cDNA clones and 15 genes, at an estimated false discovery rate of 2\%), and PAM (31 cDNAs and 15 genes). There were 8 genes identified by all three of these related methods (E-cadherin, survivin, cathepsin B, TPI1, SPRY1, SCYA14, TFAP2B, and thrombospondin 4), and an additional 3 that were identified by significance analysis for microarrays and PAM (osteopontin, HLA-G, and CHC1). To validate the differential expression of these genes, 7 of them were tested by real-time quantitative PCR, which verified that they were differentially expressed in lobular versus ductal tumors. In conclusion, specific changes in gene expression distinguish lobular from ductal breast carcinomas. These genes may be important in understanding the basis of phenotypic differences among breast cancers.},

@article{miller2007changes,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify changes in tumour expression profiling associated with short-term therapy of breast cancer patients with letrozole. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Microarray analysis was performed on RNA extracted from paired tumour core biopsies taken before and after 14 days of treatment with letrozole (2.5 mg/daily) in 58 patients. Changes in expression profile were identified by three different approaches on the basis of frequency of changes, magnitude of changes and significance analysis of microarray. RESULTS: No single gene was consistently changed by therapy in all cases. Fifty-two genes, however, were downregulated and 36 upregulated in at least 45 of the 58 cases. In terms of quantitative change, 46 genes showed at least a median 1.5-fold change in expression. Significance analysis of microarray identified 62 genes that were significantly changed by therapy (P<0.0001, 56 downregulated and six upregulated). All three approaches showed that greater numbers of genes were downregulated rather than upregulated. Merging data produced a total of 143 genes, which were subject to gene ontology and cluster analysis. The ontology of the 91 downregulated genes showed that they were functionally associated with cell cycle progression, particularly mitosis. In contrast, upregulated genes were associated with organ development, connective tissue extracellular matrix regulation and inflammatory response. Cluster analysis segregated the patients into four groups differing in patterns of gene expression. CONCLUSION: Genes have been identified which either change markedly or consistently in breast cancer after 14 days treatment with letrozole. These are new important data in understanding letrozole's molecular mechanism of action in breast cancers.},

@article{popovici2010effect,
	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: As part of the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC)-II project, this analysis examines how the choice of univariate feature-selection methods and classification algorithms may influence the performance of genomic predictors under varying degrees of prediction difficulty represented by three clinically relevant endpoints. METHODS: We used gene-expression data from 230 breast cancers (grouped into training and independent validation sets), and we examined 40 predictors (five univariate feature-selection methods combined with eight different classifiers) for each of the three endpoints. Their classification performance was estimated on the training set by using two different resampling methods and compared with the accuracy observed in the independent validation set. RESULTS: A ranking of the three classification problems was obtained, and the performance of 120 models was estimated and assessed on an independent validation set. The bootstrapping estimates were closer to the validation performance than were the cross-validation estimates. The required sample size for each endpoint was estimated, and both gene-level and pathway-level analyses were performed on the obtained models. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that genomic predictor accuracy is determined largely by an interplay between sample size and classification difficulty. Variations on univariate feature-selection methods and choice of classification algorithm have only a modest impact on predictor performance, and several statistically equally good predictors can be developed for any given classification problem.},

@article{reyal2008comprehensive,
	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Several gene expression signatures have been proposed and demonstrated to be predictive of outcome in breast cancer. In the present article we address the following issues: Do these signatures perform similarly? Are there (common) molecular processes reported by these signatures? Can better prognostic predictors be constructed based on these identified molecular processes? METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of the performance of nine gene expression signatures on seven different breast cancer datasets. To better characterize the functional processes associated with these signatures, we enlarged each signature by including all probes with a significant correlation to at least one of the genes in the original signature. The enrichment of functional groups was assessed using four ontology databases. RESULTS: The classification performance of the nine gene expression signatures is very similar in terms of assigning a sample to either a poor outcome group or a good outcome group. Nevertheless the concordance in classification at the sample level is low, with only 50\% of the breast cancer samples classified in the same outcome group by all classifiers. The predictive accuracy decreases with the number of poor outcome assignments given to a sample. The best classification performance was obtained for the group of patients with only good outcome assignments. Enrichment analysis of the enlarged signatures revealed 11 functional modules with prognostic ability. The combination of the RNA-splicing and immune modules resulted in a classifier with high prognostic performance on an independent validation set. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that the nine signatures perform similarly but exhibit a large degree of discordance in prognostic group assignment. Functional analyses indicate that proliferation is a common cellular process, but that other functional categories are also enriched and show independent prognostic ability. We provide new evidence of the potentially promising prognostic impact of immunity and RNA-splicing processes in breast cancer.},

Training programs are needed that educate a new kind of informatics professional, Biological Information Specialists, to work in collaboration with various discipline-specific research personnel.

	Abstract = {KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic information with higher order functional information. The genomic information is stored in the GENES database, which is a collection of gene catalogs for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes with up-to-date annotation of gene functions. The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www. genome.ad.jp/kegg/).},

@article{ma2010detection,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prognosis is of critical interest in breast cancer research. Biomedical studies suggest that genomic measurements may have independent predictive power for prognosis. Gene profiling studies have been conducted to search for predictive genomic measurements. Genes have the inherent pathway structure, where pathways are composed of multiple genes with coordinated functions. The goal of this study is to identify gene pathways with predictive power for breast cancer prognosis. Since our goal is fundamentally different from that of existing studies, a new pathway analysis method is proposed. RESULTS: The new method advances beyond existing alternatives along the following aspects. First, it can assess the predictive power of gene pathways, whereas existing methods tend to focus on model fitting accuracy only. Second, it can account for the joint effects of multiple genes in a pathway, whereas existing methods tend to focus on the marginal effects of genes. Third, it can accommodate multiple heterogeneous datasets, whereas existing methods analyze a single dataset only. We analyze four breast cancer prognosis studies and identify 97 pathways with significant predictive power for prognosis. Important pathways missed by alternative methods are identified. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method provides a useful alternative to existing pathway analysis methods. Identified pathways can provide further insights into breast cancer prognosis.},

@article{hsu2010immune,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT The host immune response can impact cancer growth, prognosis, and response to therapy. In colorectal cancer, the presence of cells involved with T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity predicts survival better than the current staging method. We used the expression of genes recently associated with host immune responses (T(H1)-mediated adaptive immunity, inflammation, and immune suppression) to perform hierarchical clustering of multiple large cohorts of cancer specimens to determine if immune-related gene expression resulted in clinical significant groupings of tumors. Microarray data from prostate cancer (n = 79), breast cancer (n = 132), lung cancer (n = 84), glioblastoma multiforme (n = 120), and lymphoma (n = 127) were analyzed. Among adenocarcinomas, the T(H1)-mediated adaptive immunity genes were consistently associated with better prognosis, while genes associated with inflammation and immune suppression were variably associated with outcome. Specifically, increased expression of the T(H1)-mediated adaptive immunity genes was associated with good prognosis in breast cancer patients under 45 years of age (p = .04, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.42) and in prostate cancer patients (p = .03, HR = 0.36) but not in lung cancer patients (p = 0.45, HR = 1.37). In lymphoma, patients with increased expression of inflammation and immune suppression genes had better prognosis than those expressing the T(H1)-mediated adaptive immunity genes (p = .01, HR = 0.43) and in glioblastoma multiforme, the expression of inflammation genes conferred improved prognosis than those expressing immune suppression genes (p = 0.05, HR = 0.62). In aggregate, the gene expression signatures implicating specific components of the immune response hold prognostic import across solid tumors.},

@article{wang2010bmi1,
	Abstract = {Knockout and knockdown studies have shown that the polycomb gene Bmi-1 is important for mouse postnatal and prenatal neural stem cells (NSCs) self-renewal and proliferation. Different downstream targets of Bmi-1 gene have been identified in mouse, including Ink4a/Arf locus in adult NSCs and p21 gene in embryonic NSCs. However, little is known regarding the role of Bmi-1 in human NSCs. Here, using lentiviral-delivered shRNA knockdown and over-expression techniques, we examined whether Bmi-1 is required for the self-renewal and proliferation of human fetal NSCs (hfNSCs) in vitro. Our results showed that shRNA-mediated Bmi-1 reduction profoundly impaired hfNSCs self-renewal and proliferation, whereas Bmi-1 over-expression promoted hfNSCs self-renewal capacity. Interestingly, different from mouse embryonic NSCs, Bmi-1 repressed Ink4a/Arf locus instead of p21 gene in human fetal NSCs. Moreover, Bmi-1 knockdown induced obvious senescence phenotype in hfNSCs. Further studies on the Bmi-1 pathways would help to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying hfNSCs self-renewal and human brain development.},

@article{lowell2006notch,
	Abstract = {A central challenge in embryonic stem (ES) cell biology is to understand how to impose direction on primary lineage commitment. In basal culture conditions, the majority of ES cells convert asynchronously into neural cells. However, many cells resist differentiation and others adopt nonneural fates. Mosaic activation of the neural reporter Sox-green fluorescent protein suggests regulation by cell-cell interactions. We detected expression of Notch receptors and ligands in mouse ES cells and investigated the role of this pathway. Genetic manipulation to activate Notch constitutively does not alter the stem cell phenotype. However, upon withdrawal of self-renewal stimuli, differentiation is directed rapidly and exclusively into the neural lineage. Conversely, pharmacological or genetic interference with Notch signalling suppresses the neural fate choice. Notch promotion of neural commitment requires parallel signalling through the fibroblast growth factor receptor. Stromal cells expressing Notch ligand stimulate neural specification of human ES cells, indicating that this is a conserved pathway in pluripotent stem cells. These findings define an unexpected and decisive role for Notch in ES cell fate determination. Limiting activation of endogenous Notch results in heterogeneous lineage commitment. Manipulation of Notch signalling is therefore likely to be a key factor in taking command of ES cell lineage choice.},

Self-renewal has been shown to be regulated by the Hedgehog, Notch, and Wnt pathways and the transcription factor B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 (Bmi-1). We review data about the existence of stem cells in the mammary gland and the pathways regulating the self-renewal of these cells. We present evidence that deregulation of the self-renewal in stem cells/progenitors might be a key event in mammary carcinogenesis. If 'tumor stem cells' are inherently resistant to current therapies, targeting stem cell self-renewal pathways might provide a novel approach for breast cancer treatment.},

	Abstract = {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition have begun to attracted many attentions as a potential mechanism for metastasis. The phenotypic changes of increased motility and invasiveness of cancer cells are reminiscent of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that associates with the downregulation of E-cadherin. Snail, zinc finger transcription factor, triggers this process by repressing E-cadherin expression. Recently Snail was found to be dually regulated GSK-3beta through protein stability and cellular localization. The involvement of GSK-3beta and beta-Trcp in the regulation of Snail is particular interesting, because these two molecules are also known to involve in the regulation of Wnt and hedgehog pathways that are known to control cell fate and morphogenesis during development and tumorigenesis. Here, we briefly compare these pathways and propose the possibility of cross-talk among these pathways in the regulation of cell adhesion, cell fate, and migration during metastasis.},

@article{dievart1999involvement,
	Abstract = {The MMTV/neu transgenic (Tg) mice spontaneously develop mammary tumors stochastically after a long latent period, suggesting that the c-neu/erbB2 oncogene is not sufficient for tumor formation. To identify putative collaborator(s) of the c-neu/erbB2, we used the provirus insertional mutagenesis approach with mammary tumors arising in MMTV/neu Tg mice infected with the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). The Notch1 gene was identified as a novel target for MMTV provirus insertional activation. In Notch1-rearranged tumors, the Notch1 gene was interrupted by the MMTV provirus insertion upstream of the exons coding for the TM domain. These insertions led to overexpression of novel 5' truncated approximately 7 kb RNA coding for 280 kDa mutant protein harboring only the Notch1 ectodomain, N(EC)mut. These may be involved in tumor formation. Another consequence of these insertions was the expression of truncated 3' Notch1 transcripts (3.5 - 4.5 kb) and proteins (86 - 110 kDa) deleted of most of the extracellular sequences (Notch1intra). We found that 3' truncated Notch1intra can transform HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells in vitro. Deletion analysis revealed that the ankyrin-repeats and the domain 1 (aa 1751 - 1821) are required, while a signal peptide, the two conserved cysteines (C1652 and C1685) and the OPA and PEST sequences are dispensable for transformation. These results indicate that the N-terminally truncated Notch1intra protein behaves as an oncogene in this system.},

@article{dontu2004role,
	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Notch signaling has been implicated in the regulation of cell-fate decisions such as self-renewal of adult stem cells and differentiation of progenitor cells along a particular lineage. Moreover, depending on the cellular and developmental context, the Notch pathway acts as a regulator of cell survival and cell proliferation. Abnormal expression of Notch receptors has been found in different types of epithelial metaplastic lesions and neoplastic lesions, suggesting that Notch may act as a proto-oncogene. The vertebrate Notch1 and Notch4 homologs are involved in normal development of the mammary gland, and mutated forms of these genes are associated with development of mouse mammary tumors. METHODS: In order to determine the role of Notch signaling in mammary cell-fate determination, we have utilized a newly described in vitro system in which mammary stem/progenitor cells can be cultured in suspension as nonadherent 'mammospheres'. Notch signaling was activated using exogenous ligands, or was inhibited using previously characterized Notch signaling antagonists. RESULTS: Utilizing this system, we demonstrate that Notch signaling can act on mammary stem cells to promote self-renewal and on early progenitor cells to promote their proliferation, as demonstrated by a 10-fold increase in secondary mammosphere formation upon addition of a Notch-activating DSL peptide. In addition to acting on stem cells, Notch signaling is also able to act on multipotent progenitor cells, facilitating myoepithelial lineage-specific commitment and proliferation. Stimulation of this pathway also promotes branching morphogenesis in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures. These effects are completely inhibited by a Notch4 blocking antibody or a gamma secretase inhibitor that blocks Notch processing. In contrast to the effects of Notch signaling on mammary stem/progenitor cells, modulation of this pathway has no discernable effect on fully committed, differentiated, mammary epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that Notch signaling plays a critical role in normal human mammary development by acting on both stem cells and progenitor cells, affecting self-renewal and lineage-specific differentiation. Based on these findings we propose that abnormal Notch signaling may contribute to mammary carcinogenesis by deregulating the self-renewal of normal mammary stem cells.},

@article{haupt1993bmi,
	Abstract = {The bmi-1 gene was discovered as a frequent target of Moloney virus insertion in virally accelerated B-lymphoid tumors of E mu-myc transgenic mice and hence is thought to collaborate with the myc gene in lymphomagenesis, but its oncogenic potential has not previously been tested directly. To determine whether bmi-1 overexpression can contribute to hematopoietic neoplasia in vivo, strains of transgenic mice were generated in which bmi-1 expression was directed to the lymphoid compartment by a coupled immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (E mu). Although the E mu-bmi-1 transgene was expressed in both B and T cells, lymphoid development was not perturbed. Nevertheless, 14\% of the mice in the strain with highest expression have developed lymphoma. Unexpectedly, most tumors were of the T-cell lineage, although one case of B lymphoma was observed. Furthermore, cross breeding E mu-bmi-1 and E mu-myc mice established that the bmi-1 transgene markedly accelerated the onset of pre-B and B lymphomas. These results demonstrate directly that bmi-1 can contribute to lymphomagenesis in the T and B cell lineages and collaborate with the myc gene in tumor development.},

@article{pietersen2008bmi1,
	Abstract = {PolycombGroup (PcG) proteins are epigenetic silencers involved in maintaining cellular identity, and their deregulation can result in cancer [1]. Mice without the PcG gene Bmi1 are runted and suffer from progressive loss of hematopoietic and neural stem cells [2-4]. Here, we assess the effects of Bmi1 on stem cells and differentiation of an epithelial tissue in vivo. We chose the mammary gland because it allows limiting dilution transplantations [5, 6] and because Bmi1 is overexpressed in breast cancer [7, 8]. Our analyses show that Bmi1 is expressed in all cells of the mouse mammary gland and is especially high in luminal cells. Loss of Bmi1 results in a severe mammary-epithelium growth defect, which can be rescued by codeletion of the Ink4a/Arf locus or pregnancy. Even though mammary stem cells are present in the absence of Bmi1, their activity is reduced, and this is only partially due to Ink4a/Arf expression. Interestingly, loss of Bmi1 causes premature lobuloalveolar differentiation, whereas overexpression of Bmi1 inhibits lobuloalveolar differentiation induced by pregnancy hormones. Because Bmi1 affects not only mammary stem cells but also more committed cells, our data warrant a more detailed analysis of the different roles of Bmi1 in breast-cancer etiology.},

Bayesian networks have been suggested for learning gene regulatory networks from observational data. Not all causal relationships can be inferred from correlation data alone. Often several equivalent but different directed graphs explain the data equally well. Intervention experiments where genes are manipulated can help to narrow down the range of possible networks. RESULTS: We describe an active learning algorithm that suggests an optimized sequence of intervention experiments. Simulation experiments show that our selection scheme is better than an unguided choice of interventions in learning the correct network and compares favorably in running time and results with methods based on value of information calculations.},

@article{werhli2007reconstructing,
	Abstract = {There have been various attempts to reconstruct gene regulatory networks from microarray expression data in the past. However, owing to the limited amount of independent experimental conditions and noise inherent in the measurements, the results have been rather modest so far. For this reason it seems advisable to include biological prior knowledge, related, for instance, to transcription factor binding locations in promoter regions or partially known signalling pathways from the literature. In the present paper, we consider a Bayesian approach to systematically integrate expression data with multiple sources of prior knowledge. Each source is encoded via a separate energy function, from which a prior distribution over network structures in the form of a Gibbs distribution is constructed. The hyperparameters associated with the different sources of prior knowledge, which measure the influence of the respective prior relative to the data, are sampled from the posterior distribution with MCMC. We have evaluated the proposed scheme on the yeast cell cycle and the Raf signalling pathway. Our findings quantify to what extent the inclusion of independent prior knowledge improves the network reconstruction accuracy, and the values of the hyperparameters inferred with the proposed scheme were found to be close to optimal with respect to minimizing the reconstruction error.},

Several journals require public data deposition and several public databases exist. However, not all data are publicly available, and even when available, it is unknown whether the published results are reproducible by independent scientists. Here we evaluated the replication of data analyses in 18 articles on microarray-based gene expression profiling published in Nature Genetics in 2005-2006. One table or figure from each article was independently evaluated by two teams of analysts. We reproduced two analyses in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were mostly due to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis. Repeatability of published microarray studies is apparently limited. More strict publication rules enforcing public data availability and explicit description of data processing and analysis should be considered.},

@article{bauer2010erprher2,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:The 2007 St Gallen international expert consensus statement describes three risk categories and provides recommendations for treatment of early breast cancer. The set of recommendations on how to best treat primary breast cancer is recognized and used by clinicians worldwide. We now examine the variability of five-year survival of the 2007 St Gallen Risk Classifications utilizing the ER/PR/HER2 subtypes.METHODS:Using the population-based California Cancer Registry, 114,786 incident cases of Stages 1-3 invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2006 were identified. Cases were assigned to Low, Intermediate, or High Risk categories. Five-year relative survival was computed for the three St Gallen risk categories and for the ER/PR/HER2 subtypes for further differentiation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:There were 9,124 (13%) cases classified as Low Risk, 44,234 (65%) cases as Intermediate Risk, and 14,340 (21%) as High Risk. Within the Intermediate Risk group, 33,735 (76%) were node-negative (Intermediate Risk 2) and 10,499 (24%) were node-positive (Intermediate Risk 3). For the High Risk group, 6,149 (43%) had 1 to 3 positive axillary lymph nodes (High Risk 4) and 8,191 (57%) had four or more positive lymph nodes (High Risk 5). 
Using five-year relative survival as the principal criterion, we found the following: a) There was very little difference between the Low Risk and Intermediate Risk categories; b) Use of the ER/PR/HER2 subtypes within the Intermediate and High Risk categories separated each into a group with better five-year survival (ER-positive) and a group with worse survival (ER-negative), irrespective of HER2-status; c) The heterogeneity of the High Risk category was most evident when one examined the ER/PR/HER2 subtypes with four or more positive axillary lymph nodes; (d) HER2-positivity did not always translate to worse survival, as noted when one compared the triple positive subtype (ER+/PR+/HER2+) to the triple negative subtype (ER-/PR-/HER2-); and (e) ER-negativity appeared to be a stronger predictor of poor survival than HER2-positivity. CONCLUSION:The use of ER/PR/HER2 subtype highlights the marked heterogeneity of the Intermediate and High Risk categories of the 2007 St Gallen statements. The use of ER/PR/HER2 subtypes and correlation with molecular classification of breast cancer is recommended.

	Abstract = {With insights gained through molecular profiling, cancer is recognized as a heterogeneous disease with distinct subtypes and outcomes that can be predicted by a limited number of biomarkers. Statistical methods such as supervised classification and machine learning identify distinguishing features associated with disease subtype but are not necessarily clear or interpretable on a biological level. Genes with bimodal transcript expression, however, may serve as excellent candidates for disease biomarkers with each mode of expression readily interpretable as a biological state. The recent article by Wang et al, entitled "The Bimodality Index: A Criterion for Discovering and Ranking Bimodal Signatures from Cancer Gene Expression Profiling Data," provides a bimodality index for identifying and scoring transcript expression profiles as biomarker candidates with the benefit of having a direct relation to power and sample size. This represents an important step in candidate biomarker discovery that may help streamline the pipeline through validation and clinical application.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identifying genes with bimodal expression patterns from large-scale expression profiling data is an important analytical task. Model-based clustering is popular for this purpose. That technique commonly uses the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for model selection. In practice, however, BIC appears to be overly sensitive and may lead to the identification of bimodally expressed genes that are unreliable or not clinically useful. We propose using a novel criterion, the bimodality index, not only to identify but also to rank meaningful and reliable bimodal patterns. The bimodality index can be computed using either a mixture model-based algorithm or Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. RESULTS: We carried out simulation studies and applied the method to real data from a cancer gene expression profiling study. Our findings suggest that BIC behaves like a lax cutoff based on the bimodality index, and that the bimodality index provides an objective measure to identify and rank meaningful and reliable bimodal patterns from large-scale gene expression datasets. R code to compute the bimodality index is included in the ClassDiscovery package of the Object-Oriented Microarray and Proteomic Analysis (OOMPA) suite available at the web site http;//bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/Software/OOMPA.},

Like BRCA1-deficient tumors, most BLC lack markers of a normal inactive X chromosome (Xi). Duplication of the active X chromosome and loss of Xi characterized almost half of BLC cases tested. Others contained biparental but nonheterochromatinized X chromosomes or gains of X chromosomal DNA. These abnormalities did not lead to a global increase in X chromosome transcription but were associated with overexpression of a small subset of X chromosomal genes. Other, equally aneuploid, but non-BLC rarely displayed these X chromosome abnormalities.

@article{silver2010efficacy,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent not used routinely for breast cancer treatment. As a DNA cross-linking agent, cisplatin may be effective treatment for hereditary BRCA1-mutated breast cancers. Because sporadic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and BRCA1-associated breast cancer share features suggesting common pathogenesis, we conducted a neoadjuvant trial of cisplatin in TNBC and explored specific biomarkers to identify predictors of response. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-eight women with stage II or III breast cancers lacking estrogen and progesterone receptors and HER2/Neu (TNBC) were enrolled and treated with four cycles of cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days. After definitive surgery, patients received standard adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy per their treating physicians. Clinical and pathologic treatment response were assessed, and pretreatment tumor samples were evaluated for selected biomarkers. Results Six (22\%) of 28 patients achieved pathologic complete responses, including both patients with BRCA1 germline mutations;18 (64\%) patients had a clinical complete or partial response. Fourteen (50\%) patients showed good pathologic responses (Miller-Payne score of 3, 4, or 5), 10 had minor responses (Miller-Payne score of 1 or 2), and four (14\%) progressed. All TNBCs clustered with reference basal-like tumors by hierarchical clustering. Factors associated with good cisplatin response include young age (P = .001), low BRCA1 mRNA expression (P = .03), BRCA1 promoter methylation (P = .04), p53 nonsense or frameshift mutations (P = .01), and a gene expression signature of E2F3 activation (P = .03). CONCLUSION Single-agent cisplatin induced response in a subset of patients with TNBC. Decreased BRCA1 expression may identify subsets of TNBCs that are cisplatin sensitive. Other biomarkers show promise in predicting cisplatin response.},

	Abstract = {Extensive expression profiling studies have shown that sporadic breast cancer is composed of five clinically relevant molecular subtypes. However, although BRCA1-related tumours are known to be predominantly basal-like, there are few published data on other classes of familial breast tumours. We analysed a cohort of 75 BRCA1, BRCA2 and non-BRCA1/2 breast tumours by gene expression profiling and found that 74\% BRCA1 tumours were basal-like, 73\% of BRCA2 tumours were luminal A or B, and 52\% non-BRCA1/2 tumours were luminal A. Thirty-four tumours were also analysed by single nucleotide polymorphism-comparative genomic hybridization (SNP-CGH) arrays. Copy number data could predict whether a tumour was basal-like or luminal with high accuracy, but could not predict its mutation class. Basal-like BRCA1 and basal-like non-BRCA1 tumours were very similar, and contained the highest number of chromosome aberrations. We identified regions of frequent gain containing potential driver genes in the basal (8q and 12p) and luminal A tumours (1q and 17q). Regions of homozygous loss associated with decreased expression of potential tumour suppressor genes were also detected, including in basal tumours (5q and 9p), and basal and luminal tumours (10q).

@article{farmer2005identification,
	Abstract = {Previous microarray studies on breast cancer identified multiple tumour classes, of which the most prominent, named luminal and basal, differ in expression of the oestrogen receptor alpha gene (ER). We report here the identification of a group of breast tumours with increased androgen signalling and a 'molecular apocrine' gene expression profile. Tumour samples from 49 patients with large operable or locally advanced breast cancers were tested on Affymetrix U133A gene expression microarrays. Principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering split the tumours into three groups: basal, luminal and a group we call molecular apocrine. All of the molecular apocrine tumours have strong apocrine features on histological examination (P=0.0002). The molecular apocrine group is androgen receptor (AR) positive and contains all of the ER-negative tumours outside the basal group. Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing indicates that oestrogen signalling is most active in the luminal group, and androgen signalling is most active in the molecular apocrine group. ERBB2 amplification is commoner in the molecular apocrine than the other groups. Genes that best split the three groups were identified by Wilcoxon test. Correlation of the average expression profile of these genes in our data with the expression profile of individual tumours in four published breast cancer studies suggest that molecular apocrine tumours represent 8-14\% of tumours in these studies. Our data show that it is possible with microarray data to divide mammary tumour cells into three groups based on steroid receptor activity: luminal (ER+ AR+), basal (ER- AR-) and molecular apocrine (ER- AR+).},

	Abstract = {Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease caused by the accumulation of genetic changes in neoplastic cells. We hypothesised that molecular subtypes of breast cancer may be driven by specific constellations of genes whose expression is regulated by gene copy number aberrations. To address this question, we analysed a series of 48 microdissected grade III ductal carcinomas using high resolution microarray comparative genomic hybridisation and mRNA expression arrays. There were 5,931 genes whose expression significantly correlates with copy number identified; out of these, 1,897 genes were significantly differentially expressed between basal-like, HER2 and luminal tumours. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that 'G1/S cell cycle regulation' and 'BRCA1 in DNA damage control' pathways were significantly enriched for genes whose expression correlates with copy number and are differentially expressed between the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. IPA of genes whose expression significantly correlates with copy number in each molecular subtype individually revealed that canonical pathways involved in oestrogen receptor (ER) signalling and DNA repair are enriched for these genes. We also identified 32, 157 and 265 genes significantly overexpressed when amplified in basal-like, HER2 and luminal cancers, respectively. These lists include known and novel potential therapeutic targets (e.g. HER2 and PPM1D in HER2 cancers). Our results provide strong circumstantial evidence that different patterns of genetic aberrations in distinct molecular subtypes of breast cancer contribute to their specific transcriptomic profiles and that biological phenomena characteristic of each subtype (e.g. proliferation, HER2 and ER signalling) may be driven by specific patterns of copy number aberrations.},

	Abstract = { The study aim to identify novel molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer by gene expression profiling with linkage to clinical and pathologic features.
 Microarray gene expression profiling was done on 285 serous and endometrioid tumors of the ovary, peritoneum, and fallopian tube. -means clustering was applied to identify robust molecular subtypes. Statistical analysis identified differentially expressed genes, pathways, and gene ontologies. Laser capture microdissection, pathology review, and immunohistochemistry validated the array-based findings. Patient survival within -means groups was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Class prediction validated -means groups in an independent dataset. A semisupervised survival analysis of the array data was used to compare against unsupervised clustering results.
 Optimal clustering of array data identified six molecular subtypes. Two subtypes represented predominantly serous low malignant potential and low-grade endometrioid subtypes, respectively. The remaining four subtypes represented higher grade and advanced stage cancers of serous and endometrioid morphology. A novel subtype of high-grade serous cancers reflected a mesenchymal cell type, characterized by overexpression of  and  and low expression of differentiation markers, including CA125 and MUC1. A poor prognosis subtype was defined by a reactive stroma gene expression signature, correlating with extensive desmoplasia in such samples. A similar poor prognosis signature could be found using a semisupervised analysis. Each subtype displayed distinct levels and patterns of immune cell infiltration. Class prediction identified similar subtypes in an independent ovarian dataset with similar prognostic trends.
 Gene expression profiling identified molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer of biological and clinical importance.

	Abstract = {The paper presents an original filter approach for effective feature selection in microarray data characterized by a large number of input variables and a few samples. The approach is based on the use of a new information-theoretic selection, the double input symmetrical relevance (DISR), which relies on a measure of variable complementarity. This measure evaluates the additional information that a set of variables provides about the output with respect to the sum of each single variable contribution. We show that a variable selection approach based on DISR can be formulated as a quadratic optimization problem: the dispersion sum problem (DSP). To solve this problem, we use a strategy based on backward elimination and sequential replacement (BESR). The combination of BESR and the DISR criterion is compared in theoretical and experimental terms to recently proposed information-theoretic criteria. Experimental results on a synthetic dataset as well as on a set of eleven microarray classification tasks show that the proposed technique is competitive with existing filter selection methods.},

	Abstract = {According to the present view, metastasis marks the end in a sequence of  genomic changes underlying the progression of an epithelial cell to a lethal  cancer. Here, we aimed to find out at what stage of tumor development  transformed cells leave the primary tumor and whether a defined genotype  corresponds to metastatic disease. To this end, we isolated single  disseminated cancer cells from bone marrow of breast cancer patients and  performed single-cell comparative genomic hybridization. We analyzed  disseminated tumor cells from patients after curative resection of the primary  tumor (stage M0), as presumptive progenitors of manifest metastasis, and from  patients with manifest metastasis (stage M1). Their genomic data were compared  with those from microdissected areas of matched primary tumors. Disseminated  cells from M0-stage patients displayed significantly fewer chromosomal  aberrations than primary tumors or cells from M1-stage patients (  < 0.008 and  < 0.0001, respectively), and their aberrations  appeared to be randomly generated. In contrast, primary tumors and M1 cells  harbored different and characteristic chromosomal imbalances. Moreover,  applying machine-learning methods for the classification of the genotypes, we  could correctly identify the presence or absence of metastatic disease in a  patient on the basis of a single-cell genome. We suggest that in breast  cancer, tumor cells may disseminate in a far less progressed genomic state  than previously thought, and that they acquire genomic aberrations typical of  metastatic cells thereafter. Thus, our data challenge the widely held view  that the precursors of metastasis are derived from the most advanced clone  within the primary tumor.

 Forty-eight patients received preoperative trastuzumab and vinorelbine weekly for 12 weeks. Single and multigene biomarker studies were done in an attempt to identify predictors of response.
 Eight of 40 (20%) patients achieved pCR (95% confidence interval, 9-36%). Of 9 additional patients recruited for protocol-defined toxicity analysis, 8 were evaluable; 42 of 48 (88%) patients had clinical response (16 patients, clinical complete response; 26 patients, clinical partial response). T tumors more frequently exhibited clinical complete response ( = 0.05) and showed a trend to exhibit pCR ( = 0.07). Five (13%) patients experienced grade 1 cardiac dysfunction during preoperative treatment. Neither HER2 nor estrogen receptor status changed significantly after exposure to trastuzumab and vinorelbine. RNA profiling identified three top-level clusters by unsupervised analysis. Tumors with extremes of response [pCR ( = 3) versus nonresponse ( = 3)] fell into separate groups by hierarchical clustering. No predictive genes were identified in pCR tumors. Nonresponding tumors were more likely to be T stage ( = 0.02) and express basal markers ( < 0.00001), growth factors, and growth factor receptors. Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor membrane expression was associated with a lower response rate (50% versus 97%;  = 0.001).
 Preoperative trastuzumab plus vinorelbine is active and well tolerated in patients with HER2-positive, operable, stage II/III breast cancer. HER2-overexpressing tumors with a basal-like phenotype, or with expression of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor and other proteins involved in growth factor pathways, are more likely to be resistant to this regimen.

	Abstract = {PurposeTo improve on current standards for breast cancer prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy benefit by developing a risk model that incorporates the gene expression-based "intrinsic" subtypes luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like.  MethodsA 50-gene subtype predictor was developed using microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction data from 189 prototype samples. Test sets from 761 patients (no systemic therapy) were evaluated for prognosis, and 133 patients were evaluated for prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to a taxane and anthracycline regimen.  ResultsThe intrinsic subtypes as discrete entities showed prognostic significance (P = 2.26E-12) and remained significant in multivariable analyses that incorporated standard parameters (estrogen receptor status, histologic grade, tumor size, and node status). A prognostic model for node-negative breast cancer was built using intrinsic subtype and clinical information. The C-index estimate for the combined model (subtype and tumor size) was a significant improvement on either the clinicopathologic model or subtype model alone. The intrinsic subtype model predicted neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy with a negative predictive value for pCR of 97%.  ConclusionDiagnosis by intrinsic subtype adds significant prognostic and predictive information to standard parameters for patients with breast cancer. The prognostic properties of the continuous risk score will be of value for the management of node-negative breast cancers. The subtypes and risk score can also be used to assess the likelihood of efficacy from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

@article{gong2007determination,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene expression microarrays are being used to develop new prognostic and predictive tests for breast cancer, and might be used at the same time to confirm oestrogen-receptor status and ERBB2 status. Our goal was to establish a new method to assign oestrogen receptor and ERBB2-receptor status to breast carcinoma based on mRNA expression measured using Affymetrix U133A gene-expression profiling. METHODS: We used gene expression data of 495 breast cancer samples to assess the correlation between oestrogen receptor (ESR1) and ERBB2 mRNA and clinical status of these genes (as established by immunohistochemical [IHC] or fluorescence in-situ hybridisation [FISH], or both). Data from 195 fine-needle aspiration (FNA) samples were used to define mRNA cutoff values that assign receptor status. We assessed the accuracy of these cutoffs in two independent datasets: 123 FNA samples and 177 tissue samples (ie, resected or core-needle biopsied tissues). Profiling was done at two institutions by use of the same platform (Affymetrix U133A GeneChip). All data were uniformly normalised with dCHIP software. FINDINGS: ESR1 and ERBB2 mRNA levels correlated closely with routine measurements for receptor status in all three datasets. Spearman's correlation coefficients ranged from 0.62 to 0.77. An ESR1 mRNA cutoff value of 500 identified oestrogen-receptor-positive status with an overall accuracy of 90\% (training set), 88\% (first validation set), and 96\% (second validation set). An ERBB2 mRNA threshold of 1150 identified ERBB2-positive status with the overall accuracy of 93\% (training set), 89\% (first validation set), and 90\% (second validation set). Reproducibility of mRNA measurements in 34 replicate experiments was high (correlation coefficient 0.975 for ESR1, 0.984 for ERBB2). INTERPRETATION: Amounts of ESR1 and ERBB2 mRNA as measured by the Affymetrix GeneChip reliably and reproducibly establish oestrogen-receptor status and ERBB2 status, respectively.},

@article{lu2008predicting,
	Abstract = {Data from gene expression arrays hold an enormous amount of biological information. We sought to determine if global gene expression in primary breast cancers contained information about biologic, histologic, and anatomic features of the disease in individual patients. Microarray data from the tumors of 129 patients were analyzed for the ability to predict biomarkers [estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2], histologic features [grade and lymphatic-vascular invasion (LVI)], and stage parameters (tumor size and lymph node metastasis). Multiple statistical predictors were used and the prediction accuracy was determined by cross-validation error rate; multidimensional scaling (MDS) allowed visualization of the predicted states under study. Models built from gene expression data accurately predict ER and HER2 status, and divide tumor grade into high-grade and low-grade clusters; intermediate-grade tumors are not a unique group. In contrast, gene expression data is inaccurate at predicting tumor size, lymph node status or LVI. The best model for prediction of nodal status included tumor size, LVI status and pathologically defined tumor subtype (based on combinations of ER, HER2, and grade); the addition of microarray-based prediction to this model failed to improve the prediction accuracy. Global gene expression supports a binary division of ER, HER2, and grade, clearly separating tumors into two categories; intermediate values for these bio-indicators do not define intermediate tumor subsets. Results are consistent with a model of regional metastasis that depends on inherent biologic differences in metastatic propensity between breast cancer subtypes, upon which time and chance then operate.},

METHODS: We analysed DNA microarray data from samples of primary breast tumours, using non-linear statistical analyses to assess multiple patterns of interactions of groups of genes that have predictive value for the individual patient, with respect to lymph node metastasis and cancer recurrence. FINDINGS: We identified aggregate patterns of gene expression (metagenes) that associate with lymph node status and recurrence, and that are capable of predicting outcomes in individual patients with about 90\% accuracy. The metagenes defined distinct groups of genes, suggesting different biological processes underlying these two characteristics of breast cancer. Initial external validation came from similarly accurate predictions of nodal status of a small sample in a distinct population. INTERPRETATION: Multiple aggregate measures of profiles of gene expression define valuable predictive associations with lymph node metastasis and disease recurrence for individual patients. Gene expression data have the potential to aid accurate, individualised, prognosis. Importantly, these data are assessed in terms of precise numerical predictions, with ranges of probabilities of outcome. Precise and statistically valid assessments of risks specific for patients, will ultimately be of most value to clinicians faced with treatment decisions.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:The development of algorithms to infer the structure of gene regulatory networks based on expression data is an important subject in bioinformatics research. Validation of these algorithms requires benchmark data sets for which the underlying network is known. Since experimental data sets of the appropriate size and design are usually not available, there is a clear need to generate well-characterized synthetic data sets that allow thorough testing of learning algorithms in a fast and reproducible manner.RESULTS:In this paper we describe a network generator that creates synthetic transcriptional regulatory networks and produces simulated gene expression data that approximates experimental data. Network topologies are generated by selecting subnetworks from previously described regulatory networks. Interaction kinetics are modeled by equations based on Michaelis-Menten and Hill kinetics. Our results show that the statistical properties of these topologies more closely approximate those of genuine biological networks than do those of different types of random graph models. Several user-definable parameters adjust the complexity of the resulting data set with respect to the structure learning algorithms.CONCLUSION:This network generation technique offers a valid alternative to existing methods. The topological characteristics of the generated networks more closely resemble the characteristics of real transcriptional networks. Simulation of the network scales well to large networks. The generator models different types of biological interactions and produces biologically plausible synthetic gene expression data.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Elucidating the molecular taxonomy of cancers and finding biological and clinical markers from microarray experiments is problematic due to the large number of variables being measured. Feature selection methods that can identify relevant classifiers or that can remove likely false positives prior to supervised analysis are therefore desirable.  Results: We present a novel feature selection procedure based on a mixture model and a non-gaussianity measure of a gene's expression profile. The method can be used to find genes that define either small outlier subgroups or major subdivisions, depending on the sign of kurtosis. The method can also be used as a filtering step, prior to supervised analysis, in order to reduce the false discovery rate. We validate our methodology using six independent datasets by rediscovering major classifiers in ER negative and ER positive breast cancer and in prostate cancer. Furthermore, our method finds two novel subtypes within the basal subgroup of ER negative breast tumours, associated with apoptotic and immune response functions respectively, and with statistically different clinical outcome.  Availability: An R-function pack that implements the methods used here has been added to vabayelMix, available from (www.cran.r-project.org).

@article{spellman1998comprehensive,
	Abstract = {We sought to create a comprehensive catalog of yeast genes whose transcript levels vary periodically within the cell cycle. To this end, we used DNA microarrays and samples from yeast cultures synchronized by three independent methods: [alpha] factor arrest, elutriation, and arrest of a cdc15 temperature-sensitive mutant. Using periodicity and correlation algorithms, we identified 800 genes that meet an objective minimum criterion for cell cycle regulation. In separate experiments, designed to examine the effects of inducing either the G1 cyclin Cln3p or the B-type cyclin Clb2p, we found that the mRNA levels of more than half of these 800 genes respond to one or both of these cyclins. Furthermore, we analyzed our set of cell cycle-regulated genes for known and new promoter elements and show that several known elements (or variations thereof) contain information predictive of cell cycle regulation.

Here we detail a multistep procedure for identifying potential key drivers of complex traits that integrates DNA-variation and gene-expression data with other complex trait data in segregating mouse populations. Ordering gene expression traits relative to one another and relative to other complex traits is achieved by systematically testing whether variations in DNA that lead to variations in relative transcript abundances statistically support an independent, causative or reactive function relative to the complex traits under consideration. We show that this approach can predict transcriptional responses to single gene-perturbation experiments using gene-expression data in the context of a segregating mouse population. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach by identifying and experimentally validating the involvement of three new genes in susceptibility to obesity.},

Genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epidemiological data and microbial data provide different angles to our understanding of gene-environment interactions and the determinants of disease and health. Our goal and our challenge are to integrate these very different types of data and perspectives of disease into a global model suitable for dissecting the mechanisms of disease and for predicting novel therapeutic strategies. This review aims to highlight the need for and problems with complex data integration, and proposes a framework for data integration. While there are many obstacles to overcome, biological models based upon multiple datasets will probably become the basis that drives future biomedical research.},

An important family of inference techniques is represented by algorithms based on information theoretic measures which rely on the computation of pairwise mutual information. This paper aims to study the impact of the entropy estimator on the quality of the inferred networks. This is done by means of a comprehensive study which takes into consideration three state-of-the-art mutual information algorithms: ARACNE, CLR, and MRNET. Two different setups are considered in this work. The first one considers a set of 12 synthetically generated datasets to compare 8 different entropy estimators and three network inference algorithms. The two methods emerging as the most accurate ones from the first set of experiments are the MRNET method combined with the newly applied Spearman correlation and the CLR method combined with the Pearson correlation. The validation of these two techniques is then carried out on a set of 10 public domain microarray datasets measuring the transcriptional regulatory activity in the yeast organism.},

The method is based on maximum relevance/minimum redundancy (MRMR), an effective information-theoretic technique for feature selection in supervised learning. The MRMR principle consists in selecting among the least redundant variables the ones that have the highest mutual information with the target. MRNET extends this feature selection principle to networks in order to infer gene-dependence relationships from microarray data. The paper assesses MRNET by benchmarking it against RELNET, CLR, and ARACNE, three state-of-the-art information-theoretic methods for large (up to several thousands of genes) network inference. Experimental results on thirty synthetically generated microarray datasets show that MRNET is competitive with these methods.},

	Abstract = {Objective: To compare the clinicopathologic features and survival in the four breast cancer subtypes defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2): ER/PR+, Her2+; ER/PR+, Her2-; ER/PR-, Her2+; and ER/PR-, Her2-.  Methods: A 7-year retrospective study of 1134 invasive breast cancer subjects. Clinical and pathologic features and survival of the four subtypes were compared.  Results: Using ER/PR+ and Her2- as a reference, ER/PR-, Her2- had the worst overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.2) and the worst disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.8-3.0). In ER/PR+, Her2-, chemotherapy conferred significant overall and disease-free survival advantages. Subtype comparison revealed statistically significant differences in outcomes.  Conclusion: The triple negative subtype has the worst overall and disease free survival. Efforts should be directed at standardization of current testing methods and development of more reliable and reproducible testing.

@article{mosley2009intrinsic,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:While global breast cancer gene expression data sets have considerable commonality in terms of their data content, the populations that they represent and the data collection methods utilized can be quite disparate. We sought to assess the extent and consequence of these systematic differences with respect to identifying clinically significant prognostic groups.METHODS:We ascertained how effectively unsupervised clustering employing randomly generated sets of genes could segregate tumors into prognostic groups using four well-characterized breast cancer data sets.RESULTS:Using a common set of 5,000 randomly generated lists (70 genes/list), the percentages of clusters with significant differences in metastasis latencies (HR p-value < 0.01) was 62%, 15%, 21% and 0% in the NKI2 (Netherlands Cancer Institute), Wang, TRANSBIG and KJX64/KJ125 data sets, respectively. Among ER positive tumors, the percentages were 38%, 11%, 4% and 0%, respectively. Few random lists were predictive among ER negative tumors in any data set. Clustering was associated with ER status and, after globally adjusting for the effects of ER-alpha gene expression, the percentages were 25%, 33%, 1% and 0%, respectively. The impact of adjusting for ER status depended on the extent of confounding between ER-alpha gene expression and markers of proliferation.CONCLUSION:It is highly probable to identify a statistically significant association between a given gene list and prognosis in the NKI2 dataset due to its large sample size and the interrelationship between ER-alpha expression and markers of proliferation. In most respects, the TRANSBIG data set generated similar outcomes as the NKI2 data set, although its smaller sample size led to fewer statistically significant results.},

@article{climent2007deletion,
	Abstract = {Despite the recent consensus on the eligibility of adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer (NNBC) based on clinicopathologic criteria, specific biological markers are needed to predict sensitivity to the different available therapeutic options. We examined the feasibility of developing a genomic predictor of chemotherapy response and recurrence risk in 185 patients with NNBC using assembled arrays containing 2,460 bacterial artificial chromosome clones for scanning the genome for DNA copy number changes. After surgery, 90 patients received anthracycline-based chemotherapy, whereas 95 did not. Tamoxifen was administered to patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors. The association of genomic and clinicopathologic data and outcome was computed using Cox proportional hazard models and multiple testing adjustment procedures. Analysis of NNBC genomes revealed a common genomic signature. Specific DNA copy number aberrations were associated with hormonal receptor status, but not with other clinicopathologic variables. In patients treated with chemotherapy, none of the genomic changes were significantly correlated with recurrence. In patients not receiving chemotherapy, deletion of eight bacterial artificial chromosome clones clustered to chromosome 11q was independently associated with relapse (disease-free survival at 10 years {+/-} SE, 40% {+/-} 14% versus 86% {+/-} 6%; P < 0.0001). The 54 patients with deletion of 11q (29%) did not present more aggressive clinicopathologic features than those without 11q loss. The adverse influence of 11q deletion on clinical outcome was confirmed in an independent validation series of 88 patients with NNBC. Our data suggests that patients with NNBC with the 11q deletion might benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy despite other clinical, pathologic, or genetic features. However, these initial findings should be evaluated in randomized clinical trials. [Cancer Res 2007;67(2):818-26]

@article{robinson2009differential,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:The latest generation of Affymetrix microarrays are designed to interrogate expression over the entire length of every locus, thus giving the opportunity to study alternative splicing genome-wide. The Exon 1.0 ST (sense target) platform, with versions for Human, Mouse and Rat, is designed primarily to probe every known or predicted exon. The smaller Gene 1.0 ST array is designed as an expression microarray but still interrogates expression with probes along the full length of each well-characterized transcript. We explore the possibility of using the Gene 1.0 ST platform to identify differential splicing events.RESULTS:We propose a strategy to score differential splicing by using the auxiliary information from fitting the statistical model, RMA (robust multichip analysis). RMA partitions the probe-level data into probe effects and expression levels, operating robustly so that if a small number of probes behave differently than the rest, they are downweighted in the fitting step. We argue that adjacent poorly fitting probes for a given sample can be evidence of differential splicing and have designed a statistic to search for this behaviour. Using a public tissue panel dataset, we show many examples of tissue-specific alternative splicing. Furthermore, we show that evidence for putative alternative splicing has a strong correspondence between the Gene 1.0 ST and Exon 1.0 ST platforms.CONCLUSION:We propose a new approach, FIRMAGene, to search for differentially spliced genes using the Gene 1.0 ST platform. Such an analysis complements the search for differential expression. We validate the method by illustrating several known examples and we note some of the challenges in interpreting the probe-level data.Software implementing our methods is freely available as an R package.},

@article{menezes2009integrated,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Genes that play an important role in tumorigenesis are expected to show association between DNA copy number and RNA expression. Optimal power to find such associations can only be achieved if analysing copy number and gene expression jointly. Furthermore, some copy number changes extend over larger chromosomal regions affecting the expression levels of multiple resident genes.  RESULTS:We propose to analyse copy number and expression array data using gene sets, rather than individual genes. The proposed model is robust and sensitive. We re-analysed two publicly available datasets as illustration. These two independent breast cancer datasets yielded similar patterns of association between gene dosage and gene expression levels, in spite of different platforms having been used. Our comparisons show a clear advantage to using sets of genes' expressions to detect associations with long-spanning, low-amplitude copy number aberrations. In addition, our model allows for using additional explanatory variables and does not require mapping between copy number and expression probes.CONCLUSIONS:We developed a general and flexible tool for integration of multiple microarray data sets, and showed how the identification of genes whose expression is affected by copy number aberrations provides a powerful approach to prioritize putative targets for functional validation.

@article{dai2005evolving,
	Abstract = {Genome-wide expression profiling is a powerful tool for implicating novel gene ensembles in cellular mechanisms of health and disease. The most popular platform for genome-wide expression profiling is the Affymetrix GeneChip. However, its selection of probes relied on earlier genome and transcriptome annotation which is significantly different from current knowledge. The resultant informatics problems have a profound impact on analysis and interpretation the data. Here, we address these critical issues and offer a solution. We identified several classes of problems at the individual probe level in the existing annotation, under the assumption that current genome and transcriptome databases are more accurate than those used for GeneChip design. We then reorganized probes on more than a dozen popular GeneChips into gene-, transcript- and exon-specific probe sets in light of up-to-date genome, cDNA/EST clustering and single nucleotide polymorphism information. Comparing analysis results between the original and the redefined probe sets reveals [~]30-50% discrepancy in the genes previously identified as differentially expressed, regardless of analysis method. Our results demonstrate that the original Affymetrix probe set definitions are inaccurate, and many conclusions derived from past GeneChip analyses may be significantly flawed. It will be beneficial to re-analyze existing GeneChip data with updated probe set definitions.

@article{thomassen2006prediction,
	Abstract = {Promising results for prediction of outcome in breast cancer have been obtained by genome wide gene expression profiling. Some studies have suggested that an extensive overtreatment of breast cancer patients might be reduced by risk assessment with gene expression profiling. A patient group hardly examined in these studies is the low-risk patients for whom outcome is very difficult to predict with currently used methods. These patients do not receive adjuvant treatment according to the guidelines of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG). In this study, 26 tumors from low-risk patients were examined with gene expression profiling. An intermediate risk group of 34 low-malignant T2 tumors that fulfilled all other low-risk criteria than tumor size was included to increase statistical power. A 32-gene classifier, HUMAC32, was identified and it predicted metastases with 80\% sensitivity and 77\% specificity. The classifier was also validated in an independent group of high-risk tumors resulting in comparable performance of HUMAC32 and a 70-gene classifier developed for this group. Furthermore, the 70-gene signature was tested in our low- and intermediate-risk samples. The results demonstrated high cross-platform consistency of the classifiers. Higher performance of HUMAC32 was demonstrated among the low-malignant cancers compared with the 70-gene classifier. This suggests that although the metastatic potential to some extend is determined by the same genes in groups of tumors with different characteristics and risk, expression-based classification specifically developed in low-risk patients have higher predictive power in this group.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Metastasis is believed to progress in several steps including different pathways but the determination and understanding of these mechanisms is still fragmentary. Microarray analysis of gene expression patterns in breast tumors has been used to predict outcome in recent studies. Besides classification of outcome, these global expression patterns may reflect biological mechanisms involved in metastasis of breast cancer. Our purpose has been to investigate pathways and transcription factors involved in metastasis by use of gene expression data sets.METHODS:We have analyzed 8 publicly available gene expression data sets. A global approach, "gene set enrichment analysis" as well as an approach focusing on a subset of significantly differently regulated genes, GenMAPP, has been applied to rank pathway gene sets according to differential regulation in metastasizing tumors compared to non-metastasizing tumors. Meta-analysis has been used to determine overrepresentation of pathways and transcription factors targets, concordant deregulated in metastasizing breast tumors, in several data sets.RESULTS:The major findings are up-regulation of cell cycle pathways and a metabolic shift towards glucose metabolism reflected in several pathways in metastasizing tumors. Growth factor pathways seem to play dual roles; EGF and PDGF pathways are decreased, while VEGF and sex-hormone pathways are increased in tumors that metastasize. Furthermore, migration, proteasome, immune system, angiogenesis, DNA repair and several signal transduction pathways are associated to metastasis. Finally several transcription factors e.g. E2F, NFY, and YY1 are identified as being involved in metastasis.CONCLUSION:By pathway meta-analysis many biological mechanisms beyond major characteristics such as proliferation are identified. Transcription factor analysis identifies a number of key factors that support central pathways. Several previously proposed treatment targets are identified and several new pathways that may constitute new targets are identified.},

@article{andre2009molecular,
	Abstract = {Purpose: We used high-resolution oligonucleotide comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays and matching gene expression array data to identify dysregulated genes and to classify breast cancers according to gene copy number anomalies.  Experimental Design: DNA was extracted from 106 pretreatment fine needle aspirations of stage II-III breast cancers that received preoperative chemotherapy. CGH was done using Agilent Human 4 x 44K arrays. Gene expression data generated with Affymetrix U133A gene chips was also available on 103 patients. All P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons.  Results: The average number of copy number abnormalities in individual tumors was 76 (range 1-318). Eleven and 37 distinct minimal common regions were gained or lost in >20% of samples, respectively. Several potential therapeutic targets were identified, including FGFR1 that showed high-level amplification in 10% of cases. Close correlation between DNA copy number and mRNA expression levels was detected. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering of DNA copy number aberrations revealed three distinct molecular classes in this data set. NMF class I was characterized by a high rate of triple-negative cancers (64%) and gains of 6p21. VEGFA, E2F3, and NOTCH4 were also gained in 29% to 34% of triple-negative tumors. A gain of ERBB2 gene was observed in 52% of NMF class II and class III was characterized by a high rate of estrogen receptor-positive tumors (73%) and a low rate of pathologic complete response to preoperative chemotherapy (3%).  Conclusion: The present study identified dysregulated genes that could classify breast cancer and may represent novel therapeutic targets for molecular subsets of cancers.

Compared to hierarchical cluster analysis, for example, this technique has advantages such as objective assessment of the optimal number of sample or gene clusters in the data, penalization of overcomplex models fitting to noise in the data and a common latent space of explanatory variables for samples and genes. Our analysis provides a clearer insight into these datasets, enabling assignment of patients to one of four principal processes, each with a distinct clinical outcome. One process is indolent and associated with under-expression across a number of genes associated with tumour growth. One process is associated with over expression of  and .

	Abstract = {Gene expression microarrays allow for the high throughput analysis of huge numbers of gene transcripts and this technology has been widely applied to the molecular and biological classification of cancer patients and in predicting clinical outcome. A potential handicap of such data intensive molecular technologies is the translation to clinical application in routine practice. In using an artificial neural network bioinformatic approach, we have reduced a 70 gene signature to just 9 genes capable of accurately predicting distant metastases in the original dataset. Upon validation in a follow-up cohort, this signature was an independent predictor of metastases free and overall survival in the presence of the 70 gene signature and other factors. Interestingly, the ANN signature and CA9 expression also split the groups defined by the 70 gene signature into prognostically distinct groups. Subsequently, the presence of protein for the principal prognosticator gene was categorically assessed in breast cancer tissue of an experimental and independent validation patient cohort, using immunohistochemistry. Importantly our principal prognosticator, CA9, showed that it is capable of selecting an aggressive subgroup of patients who are known to have poor prognosis.},

Risk prediction models can be derived with many different statistical approaches. To compare them, measures of predictive performance are derived from ROC methodology and from probability forecasting theory. These tools can be applied to assess single markers, multivariable regression models and complex model selection algorithms. This article provides a systematic review of the modern way of assessing risk prediction models. Particular attention is put on proper benchmarks and resampling techniques that are important for the interpretation of measured performance.

	Abstract = {The concordance probability is used to evaluate the discriminatory power and the predictive accuracy of nonlinear statistical models. We derive an analytical expression for the concordance probability in the Cox proportional hazards model. The proposed estimator is a function of the regression parameters and the covariate distribution only and does not use the observed event and censoring times. For this reason it is asymptotically unbiased, unlike Harrell's c-index based on informative pairs. The asymptotic distribution of the concordance probability estimate is derived using U-statistic theory and the methodology is applied to a predictive model in lung cancer.

@article{rody2007poor,
	Abstract = {Purpose: A common characteristic of mammary carcinomas is an inverse relationship between the estrogen receptor (ER) status and the proliferative activity of the tumor. Yet, a subset of ER-positive breast cancers is characterized by a high proliferation, suggesting malfunctions in ER responsiveness that influence the biological and therapeutic behavior of tumor cells. The expression of several ER-dependent genes seems to be dysregulated among those "uncoupled" tumors. One of those genes is plexin B1, a cell-surface receptor for the semaphorin Sema4D (CD 100). However, the biological role of plexin B1 in breast cancer is largely unknown.  Experimental Design: Expression data of plexin B1 were obtained from Affymetrix microarray analysis of n = 119 breast cancer specimens. Validation was done by quantitative real-time PCR and protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Expression data were compared with clinical characteristics as well as follow-up data of the disease.  Results: Low plexin B1 expression levels characterize a more aggressive tumor phenotype. The expression of plexin B1 is strongly correlated with the ER status. However, even among ER-positive tumors, loss of plexin B1 is associated with an impaired prognosis of breast cancer patients in both univariate (all patients, P = 0.0062; ER positive, P = 0.0107) and multivariate analyses (all patients, P = 0.032; ER positive, P = 0.022). Immunohistochemistry reveals that the tumor cells themselves and not the endothelial cells are the major source of plexin B1 expression in the tumor.  Conclusion: Plexin B1 acts not only as a new important prognostic but should also represent a predictive marker indicating an endocrine resistance. These data give a new insight in markers that could be involved in endocrine dysregulation of breast cancer.

@article{ruckhaberle2007microarray,
	Abstract = {Beside their structural role for the cell membrane the family of sphingolipids act as effector molecules in signal transduction with links to various aspects of cancer initiation, progression and treatment response. The "sphingolipid rheostat" balances between apoptosis inducing ceramid and growth promoting sphingosine-1-phosphate. We analyzed gene expression of 43 proteins from this pathway in different subtypes of breast cancer using microarray data of 1,269 tumor samples (test set n=171; validation sets n=1098) and observed significant differences for several genes. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), ceramide galactosyltransferase (UGT8), and Ganglioside GD3-Synthase (ST8SIA1) displayed higher expression among ER negative tumors. In contrast, glucosylceramidsynthase (GCS), dihydroceramidsynthases (LASS4, LASS 6) and acid ceramidase (ASAH1) were higher expressed in ER positive samples. Survival analysis revealed a worse outcome of patients with high SPHK1 expression. To avoid a confounding effect of the ER status we also restricted the analysis to 750 patients with ER positive tumors. Again a worse outcome was observed for tumors displaying high SPHK1 expression. While 75.8+/-1.9% of the patients with tumors low in SPHK1 expression were free of metastasis at 5 years, this was the case for only 64.9+/-3.6% of patients with tumors displaying high SPHK1 expression (P=0.008). Immunohistochemistry identified the carcinoma cells as the major source of SPHK1 expression in the tumor. The correlation of SPHK1 with a poor prognosis as well as its high expression among ER negative tumors are in line with the antiapoptotic and proliferative properties of its product sphingosine-1-phosphate. Targeting of the sphingolipid rheostat may thus open new treatment options.},

@article{yu2008precisely,
	Abstract = {Successful tumor development and progression involves the complex interplay of both pro- and anti-oncogenic signaling pathways. Genetic components balancing these opposing activities are likely to require tight regulation, because even subtle alterations in their expression may disrupt this balance with major consequences for various cancer-associated phenotypes. Here, we describe a cassette of cancer-specific genes exhibiting precise transcriptional control in solid tumors. Mining a database of tumor gene expression profiles from six different tissues, we identified 48 genes exhibiting highly restricted levels of gene expression variation in tumors (n = 270) compared to nonmalignant tissues (n = 71). Comprising genes linked to multiple cancer-related pathways, the restricted expression of this "Poised Gene Cassette" (PGC) was robustly validated across 11 independent cohorts of approximately 1,300 samples from multiple cancer types. In three separate experimental models, subtle alterations in PGC expression were consistently associated with significant differences in metastatic and invasive potential. We functionally confirmed this association in siRNA knockdown experiments of five PGC genes (p53CSV, MAP3K11, MTCH2, CPSF6, and SKIP), which either directly enhanced the invasive capacities or inhibited the proliferation of AGS cancer cells. In primary tumors, similar subtle alterations in PGC expression were also repeatedly associated with clinical outcome in multiple cohorts. Taken collectively, these findings support the existence of a common set of precisely controlled genes in solid tumors. Since inducing small activity changes in these genes may prove sufficient to potently influence various tumor phenotypes such as metastasis, targeting such precisely regulated genes may represent a promising avenue for novel anti-cancer therapies.},

Different methods for the adaption of datasets have been used in the literature. We have analyzed influences of these strategies using a pool of 3,030 Affymetrix U133A microarrays from breast cancer samples. We present data on the resulting concordance with biochemical assays of well known parameters and highlight critical pitfalls. We further propose a method for the inference of cutoff values directly from the data without prior knowledge of the true result. The cutoffs derived by this method displayed high specificity and sensitivity. Markers with a bimodal distribution like ER, PgR, and HER2 discriminate different biological subtypes of disease with distinct clinical courses. In contrast, markers displaying a continuous distribution like proliferation markers as Ki67 rather describe the composition of the mixture of cells in the tumor.},

To begin a systematic analysis of such alterations, we determined the sequence of well-annotated human protein-coding genes in two common tumor types. Analysis of 13,023 genes in 11 breast and 11 colorectal cancers revealed that individual tumors accumulate an average of approximately 90 mutant genes but that only a subset of these contribute to the neoplastic process. Using stringent criteria to delineate this subset, we identified 189 genes (average of 11 per tumor) that were mutated at significant frequency. The vast majority of these genes were not known to be genetically altered in tumors and are predicted to affect a wide range of cellular functions, including transcription, adhesion, and invasion. These data define the genetic landscape of two human cancer types, provide new targets for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention, and open fertile avenues for basic research in tumor biology.},

The availability of the human genome sequence led us to propose that systematic resequencing of cancer genomes for mutations would lead to the discovery of many additional cancer genes. Here we report more than 1,000 somatic mutations found in 274 megabases (Mb) of DNA corresponding to the coding exons of 518 protein kinase genes in 210 diverse human cancers. There was substantial variation in the number and pattern of mutations in individual cancers reflecting different exposures, DNA repair defects and cellular origins. Most somatic mutations are likely to be 'passengers' that do not contribute to oncogenesis. However, there was evidence for 'driver' mutations contributing to the development of the cancers studied in approximately 120 genes. Systematic sequencing of cancer genomes therefore reveals the evolutionary diversity of cancers and implicates a larger repertoire of cancer genes than previously anticipated.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Numerous gene lists or "classifiers" have been derived from global gene expression data that assign breast cancers to good and poor prognosis groups. A remarkable feature of these molecular signatures is that they have few genes in common, prompting speculation that they may use distinct genes to measure the same pathophysiological process(es), such as proliferation. However, this supposition has not been rigorously tested. If gene-based classifiers function by measuring a minimal number of cellular processes, we hypothesized that the informative genes for these processes could be identified and the data sets could be adjusted for the predictive contributions of those genes. Such adjustment would then attenuate the predictive function of any signature measuring that same process.RESULTS:We tested this hypothesis directly using a novel iterative-subtractive approach. We evaluated five gene expression data sets that sample a broad range of breast cancer subtypes. In all data sets, the dominant cluster capable of predicting metastasis was heavily populated by genes that fluctuate in concert with the cell cycle. When six well-characterized classifiers were examined, all contained a higher than expected proportion of genes that correlate with this cluster. Furthermore, when the data sets were globally adjusted for the cell cycle cluster, each classifier lost its ability to assign tumors to appropriate high and low risk groups. In contrast, adjusting for other predictive gene clusters did not impact their performance.CONCLUSION:These data indicate that the discriminative ability of breast cancer classifiers is dependent upon genes that correlate with cell cycle progression.},

@article{zhang200876gene,
	Abstract = {Purpose To assess the benefit from adjuvant systemic tamoxifen therapy in breast cancer risk groups identified by the previously established prognostic 76-gene signature. Methods In 300 lymph node-negative (LNN), estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients (136 treated with adjuvant tamoxifen, 164 having received no systemic adjuvant therapy), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) as a function of the 76-gene signature was determined in a multicenter fashion. Results In 136 tamoxifen-treated patients, the 76-gene signature identified a group of patients with a poor prognosis [hazard ratio (HR), 4.62; P = 0.0248]. These patients showed a 12.3% absolute benefit of tamoxifen in 10-year DMFS (HR, 0.52; P = 0.0318) compared with untreated high-risk patients. This represented a 71% increase in relative benefit compared with the 7.2% absolute benefit observed for all 300 patients without using the gene signature. In the low-risk group there was no significant 10-year DMFS benefit of tamoxifen. Conclusions The 76-gene signature defines high-risk patients who benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Although we did not study the value of chemotherapy in this study, low-risk patients identified by the 76-gene signature have a prognosis good enough that chemotherapy would be difficult to justify. The prognosis of these patients is sufficiently good, in fact, that a disease-free benefit for tamoxifen therapy is difficult to prove, though benefits in terms of loco-regional relapse and a reduction in risk for contralateral breast cancer might justify hormonal therapy in these patients.},

@article{quackenbush2007extracting,
	Abstract = {The promise of the genome project was that a complete sequence would provide us with information that would transform biology and medicine. But the `parts list' that has emerged from the genome project is far from the `wiring diagram' and `circuit logic' we need to understand the link between genotype, environment and phenotype. While genomic technologies such as DNA microarrays, proteomics and metabolomics have given us new tools and new sources of data to address these problems, a number of crucial elements remain to be addressed before we can begin to close the loop and develop a predictive quantitative biology that is the stated goal of so much of current biological research, including systems biology. Our approach to this problem has largely been one of integration, bringing together a vast wealth of information to better interpret the experimental data we are generating in genomic assays and creating publicly available databases and software tools to facilitate the work of others. Recently, we have used a similar approach to trying to understand the biological networks that underlie the phenotypic responses we observe and starting us on the road to developing a predictive biology.

	Abstract = {Access to data is something that every molecular biologist takes for granted nowadays, but data alone is of little use unless it is made available in a useable form through the development and global uptake of data standards. The challenge of standards development has been taken up by grass-roots movements working within several different branches of the biomedical research community. Many of these initiatives are proving extremely successful; for example, the Gene Ontology, which provides a controlled vocabulary for describing the properties of gene products, the Microarray Gene Expression Data Society's standards for describing microarray experiments, and the emerging standards developed by the Proteomics Standards Initiative are gaining broad acceptance. Standards development now faces its greatest ever challenge--the integration of diverse data types to fulfill the goals of systems biology. Now is the time for the communities that are developing these standards, the funding bodies that have invested so heavily in high-throughput data generation, and the publishers of biomedical research papers to cooperate fully to make the goals of integrated data analysis a reality.},

@article{djebbari2008seeded,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:DNA microarrays and other genomics-inspired technologies provide large datasets that often include hidden patterns of correlation between genes reflecting the complex processes that underlie cellular metabolism and physiology. The challenge in analyzing large-scale expression data has been to extract biologically meaningful inferences regarding these processes - often represented as networks - in an environment where the datasets are often imperfect and biological noise can obscure the actual signal. Although many techniques have been developed in an attempt to address these issues, to date their ability to extract meaningful and predictive network relationships has been limited. Here we describe a method that draws on prior information about gene-gene interactions to infer biologically relevant pathways from microarray data. Our approach consists of using preliminary networks derived from the literature and/or protein-protein interaction data as seeds for a Bayesian network analysis of microarray results.RESULTS:Through a bootstrap analysis of gene expression data derived from a number of leukemia studies, we demonstrate that seeded Bayesian Networks have the ability to identify high-confidence gene-gene interactions which can then be validated by comparison to other sources of pathway data.CONCLUSION:The use of network seeds greatly improves the ability of Bayesian Network analysis to learn gene interaction networks from gene expression data. We demonstrate that the use of seeds derived from the biomedical literature or high-throughput protein-protein interaction data, or the combination, provides improvement over a standard Bayesian Network analysis, allowing networks involving dynamic processes to be deduced from the static snapshots of biological systems that represent the most common source of microarray data. Software implementing these methods has been included in the widely used TM4 microarray analysis package.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:High-throughput real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a widely used technique in experiments where expression patterns of genes are to be profiled. Current stage technology allows the acquisition of profiles for a moderate number of genes (50 to a few thousand), and this number continues to grow. The use of appropriate normalization algorithms for qPCR-based data is therefore a highly important aspect of the data preprocessing pipeline.RESULTS:We present and evaluate two data-driven normalization methods that directly correct for technical variation and represent robust alternatives to standard housekeeping gene-based approaches. We evaluated the performance of these methods against a single gene housekeeping gene method and our results suggest that quantile normalization performs best. These methods are implemented in freely-available software as an R package qpcrNorm distributed through the Bioconductor project.CONCLUSION:The utility of the approaches that we describe can be demonstrated most clearly in situations where standard housekeeping genes are regulated by some experimental condition. For large qPCR-based data sets, our approaches represent robust, data-driven strategies for normalization.},

@article{lundin1999artificial,
	Abstract = {In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of a neural network in predicting 5-, 10- and 15-year breast-cancer-specific survival. A series of 951 breast cancer patients was divided into a training set of 651 and a validation set of 300 patients. Eight variables were entered as input to the network: tumor size, axillary nodal status, histological type, mitotic count, nuclear pleomorphism, tubule formation, tumor necrosis and age. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used as a measure of accuracy of the prediction models in generating survival estimates for the patients in the independent validation set. The AUC values of the neural network models for 5-, 10- and 15-year breast-cancer-specific survival were 0.909, 0.886 and 0.883, respectively.The corresponding AUC values for logistic regression were 0.897, 0.862 and 0.858. Axillary lymph node status (N0 vs. N+) predicted 5-year survival with a specificity of 71% and a sensitivity of 77%. The sensitivity of the neural network model was 91% at this specificity level. The rate of false predictions at 5 years was 82/300 for nodal status and 40/300 for the neural network. When nodal status was excluded from the neural network model, the rate of false predictions increased only to 49/300 (AUC 0. 877). An artificial neural network is very accurate in the 5-, 10- and 15-year breast-cancer-specific survival prediction. The consistently high accuracy over time and the good predictive performance of a network trained without information on nodal status demonstrate that neural networks can be important tools for cancer survival prediction.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: We developed a multigene predictor of pathologic complete response (pCR) to preoperative weekly paclitaxel and fluorouracil-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (T/FAC) chemotherapy and assessed its predictive accuracy on independent cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-three patients with stage I-III breast cancer were included. Pretreatment gene expression profiling was performed with oligonecleotide microarrays on fine-needle aspiration specimens. We developed predictors of pCR from 82 cases and assessed accuracy on 51 independent cases. RESULTS: Overall pCR rate was 26% in both cohorts. In the training set, 56 probes were identified as differentially expressed between pCR versus residual disease, at a false discovery rate of 1%. We examined the performance of 780 distinct classifiers (set of genes + prediction algorithm) in full cross-validation. Many predictors performed equally well. A nominally best 30-probe set Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier was selected for independent validation. It showed significantly higher sensitivity (92% v 61%) than a clinical predictor including age, grade, and estrogen receptor status. The negative predictive value (96% v 86%) and area under the curve (0.877 v 0.811) were nominally better but not statistically significant. The combination of genomic and clinical information yielded a predictor not significantly different from the genomic predictor alone. In 31 samples, RNA was hybridized in replicate with resulting predictions that were 97% concordant. CONCLUSION: A 30-probe set pharmacogenomic predictor predicted pCR to T/FAC chemotherapy with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. This test correctly identified all but one of the patients who achieved pCR (12 of 13 patients) and all but one of those who were predicted to have residual disease had residual cancer (27 of 28 patients).},

	Abstract = {In 1885, Sir Francis Galton first defined the term "regression" and completed the theory of bivariate correlation. A decade later, Karl Pearson developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, Pearson's r. Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

@article{chudin2001assessment,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Affymetrix microarrays have become increasingly popular in gene-expression studies; however, limitations of the technology have not been well established for commercially available arrays. The hybridization signal has been shown to be proportional to actual transcript concentration for specialized arrays containing hundreds of distinct probe pairs per gene. Additionally, the technology has been described as capable of distinguishing concentration levels within a factor of 2, and of detecting transcript frequencies as low as 1 in 2,000,000. Using commercially available arrays, we assessed these representations directly through a series of 'spike-in' hybridizations involving four prokaryotic transcripts in the absence and presence of fixed eukaryotic background. The contribution of probe-target interactions to the mismatch signal was quantified under various analyte concentrations.RESULTS:A linear relationship between transcript abundance and signal was consistently observed between 1 pM and 10 pM transcripts. The signal ceased to be linear above the 10 pM level and commenced saturating around the 100 pM level. The 0.1 pM transcripts were virtually undetectable in the presence of eukaryotic background. Our measurements show that preponderance of the signal for mismatch probes derives from interactions with the target transcripts.CONCLUSIONS:Landmark studies outlining an observed linear relationship between signal and transcript concentration were carried out under highly specialized conditions and may not extend to commercially available arrays under routine operating conditions. Additionally, alternative metrics that are not based on the difference in the signal of members of a probe pair may further improve the quantitative utility of the Affymetrix GeneChip(R) array.},

	Abstract = {One of the most important uses of whole-genome expression data is for the discovery of new genes with similar function to a given list of genes (the query) already known to have closely related function. We have developed an algorithm, called the gene recommender, that ranks genes according to how strongly they correlate with a set of query genes in those experiments for which the query genes are most strongly coregulated. We used the gene recommender to find other genes coexpressed with several sets of query genes, including genes known to function in the retinoblastoma complex. Genetic experiments confirmed that one gene (JC8.6) identified by the gene recommender acts with lin-35 Rb to regulate vulval cell fates, and that another gene (wrm-1) acts antagonistically. We find that the gene recommender returns lists of genes with better precision, for fixed levels of recall, than lists generated using the C. elegans expression topomap.},

@article{kane2000assessment,
	Abstract = {To examine the utility and performance of 50mer oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide probe) microarrays, gene-specific oligonucleotide probes were spotted along with PCR probes onto glass microarrays and the performance of each probe type was evaluated. The specificity of oligonucleotide probes was studied using target RNAs that shared various degrees of sequence similarity. Sensitivity was defined as the ability to detect a 3-fold change in mRNA. No significant difference in sensitivity between oligonucleotide probes and PCR probes was observed and both had a minimum reproducible detection limit of approximately 10 mRNA copies/cell. Specificity studies showed that for a given oligonucleotide probe any 'non-target' transcripts (cDNAs) >75% similar over the 50 base target may show cross-hybridization. Thus non-target sequences which have >75-80% sequence similarity with target sequences (within the oligonucleotide probe 50 base target region) will contribute to the overall signal intensity. In addition, if the 50 base target region is marginally similar, it must not include a stretch of complementary sequence >15 contiguous bases. Therefore, knowledge about the target sequence, as well as its similarity to other mRNAs in the target tissue or RNA sample, is required to design successful oligonucleotide probes for quality microarray results. Together these results validate the utility of oligonucleotide probe (50mer) glass microarrays.},

	Abstract = {Automated partial DNA sequencing was conducted on more than 600 randomly selected human brain complementary DNA (cDNA) clones to generate expressed sequence tags (ESTs). ESTs have applications in the discovery of new human genes, mapping of the human genome, and identification of coding regions in genomic sequences. Of the sequences generated, 337 represent new genes, including 48 with significant similarity to genes from other organisms, such as a yeast RNA polymerase II subunit; Drosophila kinesin, Notch, and Enhancer of split; and a murine tyrosine kinase receptor. Forty-six ESTs were mapped to chromosomes after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. This fast approach to cDNA characterization will facilitate the tagging of most human genes in a few years at a fraction of the cost of complete genomic sequencing, provide new genetic markers, and serve as a resource in diverse biological research fields.

@article{murphy2002gene,
	Abstract = {Anumber of mammalian genomes having been sequenced, an important next step is to catalog the expression patterns of all transcription units in health and disease by use of microarrays. Such discovery programs are crucial to our understanding of the gene networks that control developmental, physiological, and pathological processes. However, despite the excitement, the full promise of microarray technology has yet to be realized, as the superficial simplicity of the concept belies considerable problems. Microarray technology is very new; methodologies are still evolving, common standards have yet to be established, and many problems with experimental design and variability have still to be fully understood and overcome. This review will describe the time course of a microarray experiment--RNA isolation from sample, target preparation, hybridization to the microarray probe, data capture, and bioinformatic analysis. For each stage, the advantages and disadvantages of competing techniques are compared, and inherent sources of error are identified and discussed.

@article{lonning2007breast,
	Abstract = {Expanding knowledge, together with implementation of new techniques, has fuelled the area of translational medical research aiming at improving prognostication as well as prediction in cancer therapy. At the same time, new discoveries have revealed a biological complexity we were unaware of only a decade ago. Thus, we are faced with novel challenges with respect to how we may explore issues such as prognostication and predict drug resistance in vivo. While microarray analysis exploring expression of thousands of genes in concert represents a major methodological advancement, discoveries such as the finding of different mechanisms of epigenetic silencing, intronic mutations, that most gene transcripts in the human genome are subject to alternative splicing and that hypersplicing seems to be a tumour-related phenomenon, exemplifies a complex pathology that may not be explored with use of single analytical methods only. This paper discusses clinical settings for studying drug resistance in vivo together with a discussion of contemporary biology in this field. Notably, each individual parameter which has been found correlated to drug resistance in vivo so far represents either a direct drug target or a factor involved in DNA repair or apoptosis. On the basis of these findings, we suggest drug resistance may be explored on the basis of upfront biological hypotheses.

	Abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:The use of clustering methods for the discovery of cancer subtypes has drawn a great deal of attention in the scientific community. While bioinformaticians have proposed new clustering methods that take advantage of characteristics of the gene expression data, the medical community has a preference for using "classic" clustering methods. There have been no studies thus far performing a large-scale evaluation of different clustering methods in this context.RESULTS/CONCLUSION:We present the first large-scale analysis of seven different clustering methods and four proximity measures for the analysis of 35 cancer gene expression data sets. Our results reveal that the finite mixture of Gaussians, followed closely by k-means, exhibited the best performance in terms of recovering the true structure of the data sets. These methods also exhibited, on average, the smallest difference between the actual number of classes in the data sets and the best number of clusters as indicated by our validation criteria. Furthermore, hierarchical methods, which have been widely used by the medical community, exhibited a poorer recovery performance than that of the other methods evaluated. Moreover, as a stable basis for the assessment and comparison of different clustering methods for cancer gene expression data, this study provides a common group of data sets (benchmark data sets) to be shared among researchers and used for comparisons with new methods. The data sets analyzed in this study are available at http://algorithmics.molgen.mpg.de/Supplements/CompCancer/.},

	Abstract = {Array technologies have made it straightforward to monitor simultaneously the expression pattern of thousands of genes. The challenge now is to interpret such massive data sets. The first step is to extract the fundamental patterns of gene expression inherent in the data. This paper describes the application of self-organizing maps, a type of mathematical cluster analysis that is particularly well suited for recognizing and classifying features in complex, multidimensional data. The method has been implemented in a publicly available computer package, GENECLUSTER, that performs the analytical calculations and provides easy data visualization. To illustrate the value of such analysis, the approach is applied to hematopoietic differentiation in four well studied models (HL-60, U937, Jurkat, and NB4 cells). Expression patterns of some 6,000 human genes were assayed, and an online database was created. GENECLUSTER was used to organize the genes into biologically relevant clusters that suggest novel hypotheses about hematopoietic differentiation-for example, highlighting certain genes and pathways involved in "differentiation therapy" used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.},

	Abstract = {An efficient node-deletion algorithm is introduced to find submatrices in expression data that have low mean squared residue scores and it is shown to perform well in finding co-regulation patterns in yeast and human. This introduces "biclustering", or simultaneous clustering of both genes and conditions, to knowledge discovery from expression data. This approach overcomes some problems associated with traditional clustering methods, by allowing automatic discovery of similarity based on a subset of attributes, simultaneous clustering of genes and conditions, and overlapped grouping that provides a better representation for genes with multiple functions or regulated by many factors.},

@article{sheng2003biclustering,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Gibbs sampling has become a method of choice for the discovery of noisy patterns, known as motifs, in DNA and protein sequences. Because handling noise in microarray data presents similar challenges, we have adapted this strategy to the biclustering of discretized microarray data.  Results: In contrast with standard clustering that reveals genes   that behave similarly over all the conditions, biclustering groups genes over only a subset of conditions for which those genes have a sharp probability distribution. We have opted for a simple probabilistic model of the biclusters because it has the key advantage of providing a transparent probabilistic interpretation of the biclusters in the form of an easily interpretable fingerprint. Furthermore, Gibbs sampling does not suffer from the problem of local minima that often characterizes   Expectation-Maximization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two synthetic data sets as well as a data set from leukemia patients.  Contact: qizheng.sheng@esat.kuleuven.ac.be

@article{bendor1999clustering,
	Abstract = {Recent advances in biotechnology allow researchers to measure expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously, across different conditions and over time. Analysis of data produced by such experiments offers potential insight into gene function and regulatory mechanisms. A key step in the analysis of gene expression data is the detection of groups of genes that manifest similar expression patterns. The corresponding algorithmic problem is to cluster multicondition gene expression patterns. In this paper we describe a novel clustering algorithm that was developed for analysis of gene expression data. We define an appropriate stochastic error model on the input, and prove that under the conditions of the model, the algorithm recovers the cluster structure with high probability. The running time of the algorithm on an n-gene dataset is O[n2[log(n)]c]. We also present a practical heuristic based on the same algorithmic ideas. The heuristic was implemented and its performance is demonstrated on simulated data and on real gene expression data, with very promising results.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION:In vitro evidence suggests that PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide) activation may be associated with altered chemotherapy sensitivity in cancer.METHODS:Tumor DNA from 140 patients with stage II-III breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy was sequenced for PIK3CA mutations on exons 1, 9, and 20. Mutation status was correlated with clinical/pathological parameters and chemotherapy response as (a) pathological complete response (pCR) versus residual cancer or (b) quantitative residual cancer burden (RCB) scores, including stratification for estrogen receptor (ER) expression status, type of chemotherapy, and by exons.RESULTS:Twenty-three patients (16.4%) harbored a PIK3CA mutation, with 12, 11, and 0 mutations located in exons 9, 20, and 1, respectively. PIK3CA exon 9 mutations were more frequent among node-negative (52% versus 25%; P = 0.012) than node-positive tumors, particularly among ER-positive tumors. pCR rates and RCB scores were similar among patients with the wild-type and mutant PIK3CA genes, even after stratification by ER status, chemotherapy regimen (anthracycline versus anthracycline plus paclitaxel), or exon.CONCLUSION:PIK3CA mutations are not associated with altered sensitivity to preoperative anthracycline-based or taxane-based chemotherapies in ER-positive and ER-negative breast tumors. In this study, PIK3CA mutation was associated with a decreased rate of node-positive disease, particularly among ER-positive tumors.},

	Abstract = {Genomes with their complexity and size present what appears to be an impossible challenge. Scientists speak in terms of decades or even centuries before we will understand how genomes and their hosts the cell and the city of cells that make up the multicellular context function. We believe that there will be surprisingly quick progress made in our understanding of genomes. The key is to stop taking the Central Dogma as the only direction in which genome research can scale the semantics of genomes. Instead a top-down approach coupled with a bottom-up approach may snare the unwieldy beast and make sense of genomes. The method we propose is to take in silico biology seriously. By developing in silico models of genomes cells and multicellular systems, we position ourselves to develop a theory of meaning for artificial genomes. Then using that develop a natural semantics of genomes.},

@article{goetz2006twogene,
	Abstract = {Purpose: In the adjuvant treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, additional markers are needed to identify women at high risk for recurrence.  Experimental Design: We examined the association between the ratio of the homeobox 13 (HOXB13) to interleukin-17B receptor (IL-17BR) expression and the clinical outcomes of relapse and survival in women with ER-positive breast cancer enrolled onto a North Central Cancer Treatment Group adjuvant tamoxifen trial (NCCTG 89-30-52).  Results: Tumor blocks were obtained from 211 of 256 eligible patients, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR profiles for HOXB13 and IL-17BR were obtained from 206 patients. The cut point for the two-gene log 2(expression ratio) that best discriminated clinical outcome (recurrence and survival) was selected and identified women with significantly worse relapse-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS), independent of standard prognostic markers. The cut point differed as a function of nodal status [node negative (59th percentile) versus node positive (90th percentile)]. In the node-positive cohort (n = 86), the HOXB13/IL-17BR ratio was not associated with relapse or survival. In contrast, in the node-negative cohort (n = 130), a high HOXB13/IL-17BR ratio was associated with significantly worse RFS [hazard ratio (HR), 1.98; P = 0.031], DFS (HR, 2.03; P = 0.015), and OS (HR, 2.4; P = 0.014), independent of standard prognostic markers.  Conclusion: A high HOXB13/IL-17BR expression ratio is associated with increased relapse and death in patients with resected node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer treated with tamoxifen and may identify patients in whom alternative therapies should be studied.

@article{konecny2004association,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Activation or overexpression of HER-2/neu is associated with up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human breast cancer cells in vitro. Preclinical experiments indicate that increased expression of VEGF may in part mediate the biologically aggressive phenotype of HER-2/neu-overexpressing human breast cancer. It was the purpose of this study to: (a). evaluate the association between HER-2/neu and VEGF expression in a large clinical cohort of primary breast cancer patients; (b). compare the prognostic significance of VEGF isoforms; and (c). analyze the combined effects of HER-2/neu and VEGF on clinical outcome. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HER-2/neu and VEGF were measured by ELISA in primary breast tumor tissue lysates from 611 unselected patients with a median clinical follow-up of 50 months. At least six VEGF isoforms consisting of 121, 145, 165, 183, 189, or 206 amino acids are generated as a result of alternative splicing. The VEGF(121-206) ELISA uses antibodies that bind to VEGF(121) and, therefore, detects all of the VEGF isoforms with 121 and more amino acids. The VEGF(165-206) ELISA uses antibodies that bind to VEGF(165) and, therefore, detects all of the VEGF isoforms with 165 and more amino acids. VEGF(121-206) and VEGF(165-206) were analyzed both as continuous and categorical variables, using detectable expression as a cutoff for positivity. Cell lines with defined HER-2/neu expression levels were used to establish a cutoff point for HER-2/neu overexpression in breast tumor samples. RESULTS: Our findings indicate a significant positive association between HER-2/neu and VEGF expression. VEGF(121-206) and VEGF(165-206) expression was detectable in 88 (77.2%) and 100 (87.7%), respectively, of the 114 patients with HER-2/neu-overexpressing tumors, in contrast to 271 (54.5%) and 353 (71.0%), respectively, of the 497 patients with nonoverexpressing tumors (chi(2) test: P < 0.001 for both VEGF(121-206) and VEGF(165-206)). VEGF(121-206) and VEGF(165-206) demonstrate a comparable prognostic significance for survival in unselected primary breast cancer patients (univariate analysis: VEGF(121-206), P = 0.0068; VEGF(165-206), P = 0.0046; multivariate analysis: VEGF(121-206), P = 0.1475; VEGF(165-206), P = 0.1483). When the analyses were performed separately for node-negative and node-positive patients, VEGF(121-206) and VEGF(165-206) were of prognostic significance for survival only in node-positive patients (univariate analysis: VEGF(121-206), P = 0.0003; VEGF(165-206), P = 0.0038; multivariate analysis: VEGF(121-206), P = 0.0103; VEGF(165-206), P = 0.0150). A biological concentration-effect relationship between VEGF expression and survival (VEGF(121-206), P = 0.0280; VEGF(165-206,) P = 0.0097) suggests that VEGF levels, as determined by ELISA, could be of importance as a predictive marker for therapeutic strategies that target VEGF. Combining HER-2/neu and VEGF(121-206)/VEGF(165-206) results in additional prognostic information for survival (VEGF(121-206), P = 0.0133; VEGF(165-206), P = 0.0092). CONCLUSION: The positive association between HER-2/neu and VEGF expression implicates VEGF in the aggressive phenotype exhibited by HER-2/neu overexpression, and supports the use of combination therapies directed against both HER-2/neu and VEGF for treatment of breast cancers that overexpress HER-2/neu.},

@article{mcshane2005reporting,
	Abstract = {Despite years of research and hundreds of reports on tumor markers in oncology, the number of markers that have emerged as clinically useful is pitifully small. Often, initially reported studies of a marker show great promise, but subsequent studies on the same or related markers yield inconsistent conclusions or stand in direct contradiction to the promising results. It is imperative that we attempt to understand the reasons that multiple studies of the same marker lead to differing conclusions. A variety of methodologic problems have been cited to explain these discrepancies. Unfortunately, many tumor marker studies have not been reported in a rigorous fashion, and published articles often lack sufficient information to allow adequate assessment of the quality of the study or the generalizability of study results. The development of guidelines for the reporting of tumor marker studies was a major recommendation of the National Cancer Institute-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (NCI-EORTC) First International Meeting on Cancer Diagnostics in 2000. As for the successful CONSORT initiative for randomized trials and for the STARD statement for diagnostic studies, we suggest guidelines to provide relevant information about the study design, preplanned hypotheses, patient and specimen characteristics, assay methods, and statistical analysis methods. In addition, the guidelines suggest helpful presentations of data and important elements to include in discussions. The goal of these guidelines is to encourage transparent and complete reporting so that the relevant information will be available to others to help them to judge the usefulness of the data and understand the context in which the conclusions apply.

@article{mauri2005neoadjuvant,
	Abstract = {Background: Interest in the use of preoperative systemic treatment in the management of breast cancer has increased because such neoadjuvant therapy appears to reduce the extent of local surgery required. We compared the clinical end points of patients with breast cancer treated preoperatively with systemic therapy (neoadjuvant therapy) and of those treated postoperatively with the same regimen (adjuvant therapy) in a meta-analysis of randomized trials. Methods: We evaluated nine randomized studies, including a total of 3946 patients with breast cancer, that compared neoadjuvant therapy with adjuvant therapy regardless of what additional surgery and/or radiation treatment was used. Fixed and random effects methods were used to combine data. Primary outcomes were death, disease progression, distant disease recurrence, and loco-regional disease recurrence. Secondary outcomes were local response and conservative local treatment. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: We found no statistically or clinically significant difference between neoadjuvant therapy and adjuvant therapy arms associated with death (summary risk ratio [RR] = 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90 to 1.12), disease progression (summary RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.07), or distant disease recurrence (summary RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.06). However, neoadjuvant therapy was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of loco-regional disease recurrences (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.43), compared with adjuvant therapy, especially in trials where more patients in the neoadjuvant, than the adjuvant, arm received radiation therapy without surgery (RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.11 to 2.10). Across trials, we observed heterogeneity in the rates of complete clinical response (range = 7%-65%; P for heterogeneity of <.001), pathologic response (range = 4%-29%; P for heterogeneity of <.001), and adoption of conservative local treatment (range = 28%-89% in neoadjuvant arms, P for heterogeneity of <.001). Conclusions: Neoadjuvant therapy was apparently equivalent to adjuvant therapy in terms of survival and overall disease progression. Neoadjuvant therapy, compared with adjuvant therapy, was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of loco-regional recurrence when radiotherapy without surgery was adopted.

@article{ebctg2005effects,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quinquennial overviews (1985-2000) of the randomised trials in early breast cancer have assessed the 5 year and 10-year effects of various systemic adjuvant therapies on breast cancer recurrence and survival. Here, we report the 10-year and 15-year effects. METHODS: Collaborative meta-analyses were undertaken of 194 unconfounded randomised trials of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy that began by 1995. Many trials involved CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil), anthracycline-based combinations such as FAC (fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) or FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide), tamoxifen, or ovarian suppression: none involved taxanes, trastuzumab, raloxifene, or modern aromatase inhibitors. FINDINGS: Allocation to about 6 months of anthracycline-based polychemotherapy (eg, with FAC or FEC) reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by about 38% (SE 5) for women younger than 50 years of age when diagnosed and by about 20% (SE 4) for those of age 50-69 years when diagnosed, largely irrespective of the use of tamoxifen and of oestrogen receptor (ER) status, nodal status, or other tumour characteristics. Such regimens are significantly (2p=0.0001 for recurrence, 2p<0.00001 for breast cancer mortality) more effective than CMF chemotherapy. Few women of age 70 years or older entered these chemotherapy trials. For ER-positive disease only, allocation to about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by 31% (SE 3), largely irrespective of the use of chemotherapy and of age (<50, 50-69, > or =70 years), progesterone receptor status, or other tumour characteristics. 5 years is significantly (2p<0.00001 for recurrence, 2p=0.01 for breast cancer mortality) more effective than just 1-2 years of tamoxifen. For ER-positive tumours, the annual breast cancer mortality rates are similar during years 0-4 and 5-14, as are the proportional reductions in them by 5 years of tamoxifen, so the cumulative reduction in mortality is more than twice as big at 15 years as at 5 years after diagnosis. These results combine six meta-analyses: anthracycline-based versus no chemotherapy (8000 women); CMF-based versus no chemotherapy (14,000); anthracycline-based versus CMF-based chemotherapy (14,000); about 5 years of tamoxifen versus none (15,000); about 1-2 years of tamoxifen versus none (33,000); and about 5 years versus 1-2 years of tamoxifen (18,000). Finally, allocation to ovarian ablation or suppression (8000 women) also significantly reduces breast cancer mortality, but appears to do so only in the absence of other systemic treatments. For middle-aged women with ER-positive disease (the commonest type of breast cancer), the breast cancer mortality rate throughout the next 15 years would be approximately halved by 6 months of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (with a combination such as FAC or FEC) followed by 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. For, if mortality reductions of 38% (age <50 years) and 20% (age 50-69 years) from such chemotherapy were followed by a further reduction of 31% from tamoxifen in the risks that remain, the final mortality reductions would be 57% and 45%, respectively (and, the trial results could well have been somewhat stronger if there had been full compliance with the allocated treatments). Overall survival would be comparably improved, since these treatments have relatively small effects on mortality from the aggregate of all other causes. INTERPRETATION: Some of the widely practicable adjuvant drug treatments that were being tested in the 1980s, which substantially reduced 5-year recurrence rates (but had somewhat less effect on 5-year mortality rates), also substantially reduce 15-year mortality rates. Further improvements in long-term survival could well be available from newer drugs, or better use of older drugs.},

@article{veronesi2005breast,
	Abstract = {Breast cancer remains a public-health issue on a global scale. We report new information about the disease from the past 5 years. Early age at first birth, increasing parity, and tamoxifen use are related to long-term lifetime reduction in breast-cancer risk. Ductal carcinomas in situ has been suggested to be renamed ductal intraepithelial neoplasia to emphasise its non-life-threatening nature. An alternative approach, the progenitor/stem cell theory, predicts that only some tumour cells cause cancer progression and that these should be targeted by treatment. Mammography and ultrasonography are still the most effective for women with non-dense and dense breast tissues, respectively. Additionally, MRI, lymphatic mapping, the nipple-sparing mastectomy, partial breast irradiation, neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and adjuvant treatments are promising for subgroups of breast-cancer patients. Although tamoxifen can be offered for endocrine-responsive disease, aromatase inhibitors are increasingly used. Assessment of potential molecular targets is now important in primary diagnosis. Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and other drugs with anti-angiogenesis properties are currently undergoing preclinical investigations.},

@article{colozza2005proliferative,
	Abstract = {In the last few decades, proliferative markers have been broadly evaluated as prognostic and predictive factors for early stage breast cancer patients. Several papers evaluating one or more markers have been published, often with contradictory results. As a consequence, there is still uncertainty about the role of these proliferative markers. The present paper critically reviews the current knowledge about the following markers: thymidine labeling index, S phase fraction/flow cytometry, Ki 67, thymidine kinase (TK), cyclins E, cyclin D, the cyclin inhibitors p27 and p21, and topoisomerase II{alpha}. For each marker, the prognostic and predictive role was separately analyzed. Only papers published in English in peer-reviewed journals before June 2004 that include at least 100 evaluable patients were selected. In addition, the prognostic and predictive role of the proliferative markers had to be assessed through multivariate analyses. One hundred and thirty-two papers fulfilled these criteria and 159 516 patients were analyzed. Unfortunately, several methodological problems in the research to date prevent us from including any one of these proliferative markers among the standard prognostic and predictive factors. Early incorporation of translational research and new technologies with clinical trials are needed to prospectively validate biological markers and allow their use in clinical practice.

	Abstract = {We conducted this study to examine whether the expression of c-erbB-2 and p53 is the prognostic indicator for patients with early-stage breast cancer in which axillary lymph node metastasis is absent. We examined 326 patients with early-stage breast cancer in which axillary lymph node metastasis is absent. Tissue microarrays were constructed. Following this, immunohistochemical staining was done for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), c-erbB2, and p53. The results were as follows: (1) expression of c-erbB-2 was correlated with other clinicopathologic factors (eg, patient's age, presence of menopause, tumor size, histologic and nuclear grade, and presence of hormone receptors such as ER and PR); and (2) expression of p53 was correlated with survival rate, patient's age, presence of menopause, and tumor size. However, these results were not statistically significant. In conclusion, our results indicate that expression of c-erbB-2 and p53 did not have any prognostic value in patients with early-stage breast cancer in which axillary lymph node metastasis is absent.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The expressions of p53 protein and c-erbB2 have been thoroughly analyzed as prognostic factors for breast cancer. However, the prognostic significance of the coexpression of p53 protein and c-erbB2 remains controversial. METHODS: The immunohistochemical expression of p53 protein and c-erbB2 was evaluated in 242 women with breast cancer. RESULTS: According to the combination of p53 protein and c-erbB2, a group negative for both (125 cases), a group positive for either one of these two parameters (99 cases) and a group positive for both (18 cases) were identified. The group positive for one factor had a significantly (P = 0.0045) worse disease-free survival (DFS) than the group negative for both, while the group positive for both had a significantly (P = 0.0023) worse DFS than the group positive for one factor. A multivariate analysis indicated that the relative risk of p53 protein alone and cerbB2 alone was 2.18 and 2.93, respectively, while the relative risk of the group positive for one factor and the group positive for both was 2.29 and 6.37, respectively . CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer with a coexpression of p53 protein and c-erbB2 was thus found to have a more significant prognostic value than those with a positive expression for either of these two biological parameters, while the prognostic significance of these two parameters themselves remained independent of each other.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND. Amplification of erb-B2 and myc shows prognostic value in patients with operable breast cancer. Amplification is usually detected in tumor samples remaining after pathologic work-up, preventing the examination of small tumors. METHODS. Tumor imprints that contained low numbers of contaminating normal cells were obtained from small tumors. The prognostic value of erb-B2 and myc amplification in imprint breast preparations was examined, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine gene copy number. Tumor material was obtained from 162 patients with breast cancer operated 1975-1976. RESULTS. Amplification of erb-B2 existed in 21% and myc in 16% of the patients. Both erb-B2 and myc amplification showed prognostic significance in univariate analysis for survival and relapse free survival. In multivariate analysis, erb-B2 was a significant factor. In small tumors less than 13 mm in greatest dimension, erb-B2 showed prognostic significance for survival but not for relapse free survival. CONCLUSIONS. The use of imprints/PCR allows the detection of gene amplification in breast cancer. The procedure is suitable for the analysis of small tumors and can be used to examine very small tumors, such as those detected mammographically.},

	Abstract = {We reveiwed the relationships between ERBB2 amplification and/or overexpression in human breast cancer and the clinicopathological parameters described in the literature (97 studies involving 22,616 patients) in order to draw conclusions regarding its clinical interest. The mean of ERBB2 positivity (26%, ranging from 5 to 55%) is not dependent on the method used to evaluate ERBB2 amplification or overexpression. Despite the discrepancies observed between the different studies, several associations between ERBB2 positivity and the classical clinicopathological parameters were noted. There are clear relationships between ERBB2 positivity and the lack of steroid receptors, the histological subtypes of mammary tumours (ductal invasive and in situ), worse histological and nuclear grades, aneuploidy and high rate of proliferation. In univariate analyses, ERBB2 is strongly associated with poor prognosis. All these data indicate that ERBB2 is a marker of aggressiveness of the tumour. However, ERBB2 does not retain a clinical prognostic significance in multivariate analyses, since it is associated with several strong prognostic parameters. When considering the prognostic value of ERBB2 in relation to treatment, a significantly worse survival of the treated patients is noted in ERBB2 positive patients. This suggest that ERBB2 could be a marker of reduced response to chemotherapy and hormonal treatment. With respect to the tumour response to treatment, the results, provided as yet by pilot studies, remain controversial and further investigations are necessary to evaluate the predictive value of ERBB2. Finally, new therapeutic approaches targeting the cells overexpressing ERBB2 have been developed.},

@article{rouzier2005breast,
	Abstract = {Purpose: Molecular classification of breast cancer has been proposed based on gene expression profiles of human tumors. Luminal, basal-like, normal-like, and erbB2+ subgroups were identified and were shown to have different prognoses. The goal of this research was to determine if these different molecular subtypes of breast cancer also respond differently to preoperative chemotherapy.  Experimental Design: Fine needle aspirations of 82 breast cancers were obtained before starting preoperative paclitaxel followed by 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. Gene expression profiling was done with Affymetrix U133A microarrays and the previously reported "breast intrinsic" gene set was used for hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling to assign molecular class.  Results: The basal-like and erbB2+ subgroups were associated with the highest rates of pathologic complete response (CR), 45% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 24-68] and 45% (95% CI, 23-68), respectively, whereas the luminal tumors had a pathologic CR rate of 6% (95% CI, 1-21). No pathologic CR was observed among the normal-like cancers (95% CI, 0-31). Molecular class was not independent of conventional cliniocopathologic predictors of response such as estrogen receptor status and nuclear grade. None of the 61 genes associated with pathologic CR in the basal-like group were associated with pathologic CR in the erbB2+ group, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy sensitivity may vary between these two estrogen receptor-negative subtypes.  Conclusions: The basal-like and erbB2+ subtypes of breast cancer are more sensitive to paclitaxel- and doxorubicin-containing preoperative chemotherapy than the luminal and normal-like cancers.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To combine clinical variables associated with pathologic complete response (pCR) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) after preoperative chemotherapy (PC) into a prediction nomogram.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 496 patients treated with anthracycline PC at the Institut Gustave Roussy were used to develop and calibrate a nomogram for pCR based on multivariate logistic regression. This nomogram was tested on two independent cohorts of patients treated at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The first cohort (n = 337) received anthracycline; the second cohort (n = 237) received a combination of paclitaxel and anthracycline PC. A separate nomogram to predict DMFS was developed using Cox proportional hazards regression model.  RESULTS: The pCR nomogram based on clinical stage, estrogen receptor status, histologic grade, and number of preoperative chemotherapy cycles had good discrimination and calibration in the training and the anthracycline-treated validation sets (concordance indices, 0.77, 0.79). In the paclitaxel plus anthracycline group, when the predicted pCR rate was less than 14%, the observed rate was 7.5%; for a predicted rate of [&ge;] 38%, the actual rate was 85%. For a predicted rate between 14% to 38%, the observed rates were 50% with weekly and 27% with 3-weekly paclitaxel. This indicates that patients with intermediate chemotherapy sensitivity benefit the most from the optimized schedule of paclitaxel. Patients unlikely to achieve pCR to anthracylines remain at low probability for pCR, even after inclusion of paclitaxel. The nomogram for DMFS had a concordance index of 0.72 in the validation set and outperformed other prediction tools (P = .02).  CONCLUSION: Our nomograms predict pCR accurately and can serve as a basis to integrate future molecular markers into a clinical prediction model.

@article{turner2004tamoxifen,
	Abstract = {The process of cancer invasion involves a complex interplay between cell-cell and cell-medium adhesion, proteolytic enzyme secretion, cell birth and death processes, random and directed motility, and immune response, as well as many other factors. The growth factor TGF beta is known to have a complex effect on this process. It inhibits mitosis and promotes apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro, and it is for this reason that its secretion is thought to be helpful in inhibiting tumour growth. However, recent in vitro and in vivo results have shown a significant effect of this growth factor in promoting the sensitivity of malignantly transformed cells to gradients of extracellular matrix proteins--an effect which tends to increase invasiveness. The drug tamoxifen has been demonstrated to be therapeutically effective in the treatment of patients with breast cancer; however, it is known also that many patients become resistant to the effect of this drug after a few years, and the reasons for this remain controversial. In this work we take our established model of cancer invasion (J. Theor. Biol. 216(1) (2002) 85), and extend it to include the effect of TGF beta. In so doing we demonstrate that a tamoxifen-stimulated upregulation of the secretion of TGF beta may give rise to a tumour which has a smaller number of cells but which has a greater invasiveness, greater metastatic potential, and a tumour histology which is known to correlate with a poorer prognosis. These data suggest that tamoxifen-stimulated secretion of TGF beta might explain treatment failure in some patients.},

@article{prasad2004slit,
	Abstract = {Slit, which mediates its function by binding to the Roundabout (Robo) receptor, has been shown to regulate neuronal and CXCR4-mediated leukocyte migration. Slit-2 was shown to be frequently inactivated in lung and breast cancers because of hypermethylation of its promoter region. Furthermore, the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis has been reported recently to be actively involved in breast cancer metastasis to target organs such as lymph nodes, lung, and bone. In this study, we sought to characterize the effect of Slit (=Slit-2) on the CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated metastatic properties of breast cancer cells. We demonstrate here that breast cancer cells and tissues derived from breast cancer patients express Robo 1 and 2 receptors. We also show that Slit treatment inhibits CXCL12/CXCR4-induced breast cancer cell chemotaxis, chemoinvasion, and adhesion, the fundamental components that promote metastasis. Slit had no significant effect on the CXCL12-induced internalization process of CXCR4. In addition, characterization of signaling events revealed that Slit inhibits CXCL12-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion components such as RAFTK/Pyk2 at residues 580 and 881, focal adhesion kinase at residue 576, and paxillin. We found that Slit also inhibits CXCL12-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, p44/42 MAP kinase, and metalloproteinase 2 and 9 activities. However, it showed no effect on JNK and p38 MAP kinase activities. To our knowledge, this is the first report to analyze in detail the effect of Slit on breast cancer cell motility as well as its effect on the critical components of the cancer cell chemotactic machinery. Studies of the Slit-Robo complex may foster new anti-chemotactic approaches to block cancer cell metastasis.},

@article{reid2005limits,
	Abstract = {Data from microarray studies have been used to develop predictive models for treatment outcome in breast cancer, such as a recently proposed predictive model for antiestrogen response after tamoxifen treatment that was based on the expression ratio of two genes. We attempted to validate this model on an independent cohort of 58 patients with resectable estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. We measured expression of the genes HOXB13 and IL17BR with real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and assessed the association between their expression and outcome by use of univariate logistic regression, area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), a two-sample t test, and a Mann-Whitney test. We also applied standard supervised methods to the original microarray dataset and to another independent dataset from similar patients to estimate the classification accuracy obtainable by using more than two genes in a microarray-based predictive model. We could not validate the performance of the two-gene predictor on our cohort of samples (relation between outcome and the following genes estimated by logistic regression: for HOXB13, odds ratio [OR] = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.92 to 1.16, P = .54; for IL17BR, OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.40 to 1.20, P = .18; and for HOXB13/IL17BR, OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.93, P = .18). Similar results were obtained with the AUC, a two-sample two-sided t test, and a Mann-Whitney test. In addition, estimates of classification accuracies applied to two independent microarray datasets highlighted the poor performance of treatment-response predictive models that can be achieved with the sample sizes of patients and informative genes to date.

	Abstract = {Abstract~~The involvement of the immune system for the course of breast cancer, as evidenced by varying degrees of lymphocyte infiltration (LI) into the tumor is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of LI in breast cancer samples using microarray-based screening for LI-associated genes. Starting from the observation that most published ER gene signatures are heavily influenced by the LI effect, we developed and applied a novel approach to dissect molecular signatures. Further, a meta-analysis encompassing 1,044 hybridizations showed that LI alone is not sufficient to highlight breast cancer patients with different prognosis. However, for ER positive patients, high LI was associated with shorter survival times, whereas for ER negative patients, high LI is significantly associated with longer survival. Annotation of LI, in addition to ER status, is important for breast cancer patient prognosis and may have implications for the future treatment of breast cancer. },

	Abstract = {Abstract~~Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, and markers for disease subtypes and therapy response remain poorly defined. For that reason, we employed a retrospective study in node-positive breast cancer to identify molecular signatures of gene expression correlating with metastatic free survival. Patients were primarily included in FEC100 (5-fluorouracil 500&nbsp;mg/m2, epirubicin 100&nbsp;mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) arms of two multicentric prospective adjuvant clinical trials (PACS01 and PEGASE01---FNCLCC cooperative group). Data from nylon microarrays containing 8,032 cDNA unique sequences, representing 5,776 distinct genes, have been used to develop a predictive model for treatment outcome. We obtained the gene expression profiles for 150 of these patients, and used stringent univariate selection techniques based on Cox regression combined with principal component analysis to identify a genomic signature of metastatic relapse after adjuvant FEC100 regimen. Most of the 14 selected genes have a clear role in breast cancer, carcinogenesis or chemotherapy resistance. Six genes have been previously described in other genomic studies (UBE2C, CENPF, C16orf61 [DC13], STMN1, CCT5 and BCL2A1). Furthermore, we showed the interest of combining transcriptomic data with clinical data into a clinicogenomic model for patients subtyping. The described model adds predictive accuracy to that provided by the well-established Nottingham prognostic index or by our genomic signature alone. },

@article{dalgin2007portraits,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Clustering analysis of microarray data is often criticized for giving ambiguous results because of sensitivity to data perturbation or clustering techniques used. In this paper, we describe a new method based on principal component analysis and ensemble consensus clustering that avoids these problems.RESULTS:We illustrate the method on a public microarray dataset from 36 breast cancer patients of whom 31 were diagnosed with at least two of three pathological stages of disease (atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Our method identifies an optimum set of genes and divides the samples into stable clusters which correlate with clinical classification into Luminal, Basal-like and Her2+ subtypes. Our analysis reveals a hierarchical portrait of breast cancer progression and identifies genes and pathways for each stage, grade and subtype. An intriguing observation is that the disease phenotype is distinguishable in ADH and progresses along distinct pathways for each subtype. The genetic signature for disease heterogeneity across subtypes is greater than the heterogeneity of progression from DCIS to IDC within a subtype, suggesting that the disease subtypes have distinct progression pathways.Our method identifies six disease subtype and one normal clusters. The first split separates the normal samples from the cancer samples. Next, the cancer cluster splits into low grade (pathological grades 1 and 2) and high grade (pathological grades 2 and 3) while the normal cluster is unchanged. Further, the low grade cluster splits into two subclusters and the high grade cluster into four. The final six disease clusters are mapped into one Luminal A, three Luminal B, one Basal-like and one Her2+.CONCLUSION:We confirm that the cancer phenotype can be identified in early stage because the genes altered in this stage progressively alter further as the disease progresses through DCIS into IDC. We identify six subtypes of disease which have distinct genetic signatures and remain separated in the clustering hierarchy. Our findings suggest that the heterogeneity of disease across subtypes is higher than the heterogeneity of the disease progression within a subtype, indicating that the subtypes are in fact distinct diseases.},

	Abstract = {The optimal treatment of patients with cancer depends on
 establishing accurate diagnoses by using a complex combination of
 clinical and histopathological data. In some instances, this task is
 difficult or impossible because of atypical clinical presentation or
 histopathology. To determine whether the diagnosis of multiple common
 adult malignancies could be achieved purely by molecular
 classification, we subjected 218 tumor samples, spanning 14
 common tumor types, and 90 normal tissue samples to oligonucleotide
 microarray gene expression analysis. The expression levels of 16,063
 genes and expressed sequence tags were used to evaluate the accuracy of
 a multiclass classifier based on a support vector machine algorithm.
 Overall classification accuracy was 78%, far exceeding the accuracy of
 random classification (9%). Poorly differentiated cancers resulted in
 low-confidence predictions and could not be accurately classified
 according to their tissue of origin, indicating that they are
 molecularly distinct entities with dramatically different gene
 expression patterns compared with their well differentiated
 counterparts. Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility
 of accurate, multiclass molecular cancer classification and suggest a
 strategy for future clinical implementation of molecular cancer
 diagnostics.

	Abstract = {Gene expression analysis has identified biologically relevant subclasses of breast cancer. However, most classification schemes do not robustly cluster all HER2+ breast cancers, in part due to limitations and bias of clustering techniques used. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that first separates the HER2+ tumors using a gene amplification signal for Her2/neu amplicon genes and then applies consensus ensemble clustering separately to the HER2+ and HER2- clusters to look for further substructure. We applied this procedure to a microarray data set of 286 early-stage breast cancers treated only with surgery and radiation and identified two basal and four luminal subtypes in the HER2- tumors, as well as two novel and robust HER2+ subtypes. HER2+ subtypes had median distant metastasis-free survival of 99 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 83-118 months] and 33 months (95% CI, 11-54 months), respectively, and recurrence rates of 11% and 58%, respectively. The low recurrence subtype had a strong relative overexpression of lymphocyte-associated genes and was also associated with a prominent lymphocytic infiltration on histologic analysis. These data suggest that early-stage HER2+ cancers associated with lymphocytic infiltration are a biologically distinct subtype with an improved natural history. [Cancer Res 2007;67(22):10669-76]

@article{gui2005penalized,
	Abstract = {Motivation: An important application of microarray technology is to relate gene expression profiles to various clinical phenotypes of patients. Success has been demonstrated in molecular classification of cancer in which the gene expression data serve as predictors and different types of cancer serve as a categorical outcome variable. However, there has been less research in linking gene expression profiles to the censored survival data such as patients' overall survival time or time to cancer relapse. It would be desirable to have models with good prediction accuracy and parsimony property.  Results: We propose to use the L1 penalized estimation for the Cox model to select genes that are relevant to patients' survival and to build a predictive model for future prediction. The computational difficulty associated with the estimation in the high-dimensional and low-sample size settings can be efficiently solved by using the recently developed least-angle regression (LARS) method. Our simulation studies and application to real datasets on predicting survival after chemotherapy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma demonstrate that the proposed procedure, which we call the LARS-Cox procedure, can be used for identifying important genes that are related to time to death due to cancer and for building a parsimonious model for predicting the survival of future patients. The LARS-Cox regression gives better predictive performance than the L2 penalized regression and a few other dimension-reduction based methods.  Conclusions: We conclude that the proposed LARS-Cox procedure can be very useful in identifying genes relevant to survival phenotypes and in building a parsimonious predictive model that can be used for classifying future patients into clinically relevant high- and low-risk groups based on the gene expression profile and survival times of previous patients.

@article{ma2007populationbased,
	Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to predict breast cancer recurrence and metastases and to identify gene signatures indicative of clinicopathologic characteristics using gene expression patterns derived from cDNA microarray.  Experimental Design: Expression profiles of 7,650 genes were investigated on an unselected group of 99 node-negative and node-positive breast cancer patients to identify prognostic gene signature of recurrence and metastases. The identified gene signature was validated on independent 78 patients with primary invasive carcinoma (T1/T2 and N0) and on 58 patients with locally advanced breast cancer (T3/T4 and/or N2). The gene predictors were identified using a combination of random forests and linear discriminant analysis function.  Results: This study identified a new 28-gene signature that achieved highly accurate disease-free survival and overall survival (both at P < 0.001, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis) in individual breast cancer patients. Patients categorized into high-risk, intermediate-risk, and low-risk groups had distinct disease-free survival (P < 0.005, Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank test) in three patient cohorts. A strong association (P < 0.05) was identified between risk groups and tumor size, tumor grade, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status, and HER2/neu overexpression in the studied cohorts. We also identified 14-gene predictors of nodal status and 9-gene predictors of tumor grade.  Conclusions: This study has established a population-based approach to predicting breast cancer outcomes at the individual level exclusively based on gene expression patterns. The 28-gene recurrence signature has been validated as quantifying the probability of recurrence and metastases in patients with heterogeneous histology and disease stage.

@article{eden2004good,
	Abstract = {We compared the power of gene expression measurements with that of conventional prognostic markers, i.e., clinical, histopathological, and cell biological parameters, for predicting distant metastases in breast cancer patients using both established prognostic indices (e.g., the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI)) and novel combinations of conventional markers. We used publicly available data on 97 patients, and the performance of metastasis prediction was represented by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) areas and Kaplan-Meier plots. The gene expression profiler did not perform noticeably better than indices constructed from the clinical variables, e.g., the well established NPI. When analysing separately subgroups, according to the oestrogen receptor (ER) status both approaches could predict clinical outcome more easily for the ER-positive than for the ER-negative cohort. Given the time it may take before microarray processing is used worldwide, particularly due to the costs and the lack of standards, it is important to pursue research using conventional markers. Our analysis suggests that it might be possible to improve the combination of different conventional prognostic markers into one prognostic index.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:In cancer research, most clinical variables have already been investigated and are now well established. The use of transcriptomic variables has raised two problems: restricting their number and validating their significance. Thus, their contribution to prognosis is currently thought to be overestimated. The aim of this study was to determine to what extent optimism concerning current transcriptomic models may lead to overestimation of the contribution of transcriptomic variables to survival prognosis.RESULTS:To achieve this goal, Cox proportional hazards models that adjust for clinical and transcriptomic variables were built. As the relevance of the clinical variables had already been established, they were not submitted to selection. As for genes, they were selected using both univariate and multivariate methods. Optimism and the contribution of clinical and transcriptomic variables to prognosis were compared through simulations and by using the Kent and O'Quigley rho2 measure of dependence. We showed that the optimism relative to clinical variables was low because these are no longer submitted to selection of relevant variables. In contrast, for genes, the selection process introduced high optimism, which increased when the proportion of genes of interest decreased. However, this optimism can be decreased by increasing the number of samples.CONCLUSION:Two phenomena have to be taken into account by comparing the predictive power and optimism of clinical variables and those of genes: overestimation for genes due to the selection process and underestimation for clinical variables due to the omission of relevant genes. In comparison with genes, the predictive value of validated clinical variables is not overestimated, which should be kept in mind in future studies involving both clinical and transcriptomic variables.},

We consider in detail issues pertaining to creating just two groups, a common approach in clinical research. We argue that the simplicity achieved is gained at a cost; dichotomization may create rather than avoid problems, notably a considerable loss of power and residual confounding. In addition, the use of a data-derived 'optimal' cutpoint leads to serious bias. We illustrate the impact of dichotomization of continuous predictor variables using as a detailed case study a randomized trial in primary biliary cirrhosis. Dichotomization of continuous data is unnecessary for statistical analysis and in particular should not be applied to explanatory variables in regression models.},

	Abstract = {The HER-2/neu proto-oncogene encodes a 185 kDa transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase with significant sequence homology to other members of the class I receptor tyrosine kinase family. The HER-2/neu gene is amplified and/or overexpressed in 25%-30% of human breast and ovarian cancers, and overexpression of the receptor is associated with poor prognosis. Tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the HER-2 receptor lead to activation of specific signal transduction pathways in breast and ovarian cancer cells, including the ras/MAP kinase cascade, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phospholipase C-{gamma}. HER-2/neu signal transduction pathways ultimately converge on the cell nucleus, where the expression of diverse genes is induced after activation of the receptor. A more complete understanding of HER-2/neu signal transduction pathways may allow the development of specific therapeutics for the treatment of those human breast and ovarian cancers containing this alteration.

Furthermore, we find that molecular classifiers may not outperform classical prognostic indices but that they can be used in hybrid molecular-pathological classification schemes to improve prognostic separation.CONCLUSION:The prognostic molecular classifier presented here is the first to be valid in over 877 ER positive breast cancer samples and across three different microarray platforms. Larger multi-institutional studies will be needed to fully determine the added prognostic value of molecular classifiers when combined with standard prognostic factors.},

	Abstract = {Pathway-specific therapy is the future of cancer management. The oncogenic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently activated in solid tumors; however, currently, no reliable test for PI3K pathway activation exists for human tumors. Taking advantage of the observation that loss of PTEN, the negative regulator of PI3K, results in robust activation of this pathway, we developed and validated a microarray gene expression signature for immunohistochemistry (IHC)-detectable PTEN loss in breast cancer (BC). The most significant signature gene was  itself, indicating that  mRNA levels are the primary determinant of PTEN protein levels in BC. Some PTEN IHC-positive BCs exhibited the signature of PTEN loss, which was associated to moderately reduced  mRNA levels cooperating with specific types of  mutations and/or amplification of . This demonstrates that the signature is more sensitive than PTEN IHC for identifying tumors with pathway activation. In independent data sets of breast, prostate, and bladder carcinoma, prediction of pathway activity by the signature correlated significantly to poor patient outcome. Stathmin, encoded by the signature gene , was an accurate IHC marker of the signature and had prognostic significance in BC. Stathmin was also pathway-pharmacodynamic  and . Thus, the signature or its components such as stathmin may be clinically useful tests for stratification of patients for anti-PI3K pathway therapy and monitoring therapeutic efficacy. This study indicates that aberrant PI3K pathway signaling is strongly associated with metastasis and poor survival across carcinoma types, highlighting the enormous potential impact on patient survival that pathway inhibition could achieve.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Breast Task Force submitted recommended changes and additions to the existing staging system that were (1) evidence-based and/or consistent with widespread clinical consensus about appropriate diagnostic and treatment standards and (2) useful for the uniform accrual of outcome information in national databases.  RESULTS: Major changes included the following: size-based discrimination between micrometastases and isolated tumor cells; identifiers to indicate usage of innovative technical approaches; classification of lymph node status by number of involved axillary lymph nodes; and new classifications for metastasis to the infraclavicular, internal mammary, and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  CONCLUSION: This revised staging system will be officially adopted for use in tumor registries in January 2003.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate concordance between local and central laboratory HER2 testing results in patients from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N9831 adjuvant trial of trastuzumab.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: NCCTG N9831 is a randomized, phase III clinical trial comparing three drug regimens: doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with trastuzumab added concurrently, sequentially, or not at all as adjuvant therapy for women with HER2-positive resected breast cancer. Originally, patients were eligible if their tumors were HER2 positive by either local laboratory immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). A protocol modification in 2002 made central laboratory testing mandatory, with additional testing of discordant cases conducted by a reference laboratory. Concordance between local and central laboratory, and level of agreement between central and reference laboratory HER2 findings in discordant cases were examined.  RESULTS: HER2 positivity was confirmed in 85.8% of 2,535 patients registered since March 2002. When local and central evaluation used the same methodology, concordance was 88.1% for FISH and 81.6% for a diagnostic test for presence of the HER2 protein. Among discordant cases examined at the reference laboratory, there was 94.3% agreement for IHC (0, 1+, 2+) and 95.2% agreement for FISH (not gene amplified).  CONCLUSION: There was a high degree of discordance between local and central testing for IHC and FISH, but a high degree of agreement between central and reference laboratories. These findings support the importance of using high-volume, experienced laboratories for HER2 testing to improve the process of selecting patients likely to benefit from trastuzumab therapy.

@article{davis2006reliable,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Two important questions for the analysis of gene expression measurements from different sample classes are (1) how to classify samples and (2) how to identify meaningful gene signatures (ranked gene lists) exhibiting the differences between classes and sample subsets. Solutions to both questions have immediate biological and biomedical applications. To achieve optimal classification performance, a suitable combination of classifier and gene selection method needs to be specifically selected for a given dataset. The selected gene signatures can be unstable and the resulting classification accuracy unreliable, particularly when considering different subsets of samples. Both unstable gene signatures and overestimated classification accuracy can impair biological conclusions.  Methods: We address these two issues by repeatedly evaluating the classification performance of all models, i.e. pairwise combinations of various gene selection and classification methods, for random subsets of arrays (sampling). A model score is used to select the most appropriate model for the given dataset. Consensus gene signatures are constructed by extracting those genes frequently selected over many samplings. Sampling additionally permits measurement of the stability of the classification performance for each model, which serves as a measure of model reliability.  Results: We analyzed a large gene expression dataset with 78 measurements of four different cartilage sample classes. Classifiers trained on subsets of measurements frequently produce models with highly variable performance. Our approach provides reliable classification performance estimates via sampling. In addition to reliable classification performance, we determined stable consensus signatures (i.e. gene lists) for sample classes. Manual literature screening showed that these genes are highly relevant to our gene expression experiment with osteoarthritic cartilage. We compared our approach to others based on a publicly available dataset on breast cancer.  Availability: R package at http://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/~davis/edaprakt  Contact: ralf.zimmer@bio.ifi.lmu.de

	Abstract = {Nearest-centroid classifiers have recently been successfully employed in high-dimensional applications, such as in genomics. A necessary step when building a classifier for high-dimensional data is feature selection. Feature selection is frequently carried out by computing univariate scores for each feature individually, without consideration for how a subset of features performs as a whole. We introduce a new feature selection approach for high-dimensional nearest centroid classifiers that instead is based on the theoretically optimal choice of a given number of features, which we determine directly here. This allows us to develop a new greedy algorithm to estimate this optimal nearest-centroid classifier with a given number of features. In addition, whereas the centroids are usually formed from maximum likelihood estimates, we investigate the applicability of high-dimensional shrinkage estimates of centroids. We apply the proposed method to clinical classification based on gene-expression microarrays, demonstrating that the proposed method can outperform existing nearest centroid classifiers. },

@article{hu2006molecular,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Validation of a novel gene expression signature in independent data sets is a critical step in the development of a clinically useful test for cancer patient risk-stratification. However, validation is often unconvincing because the size of the test set is typically small. To overcome this problem we used publicly available breast cancer gene expression data sets and a novel approach to data fusion, in order to validate a new breast tumor intrinsic list.RESULTS:A 105-tumor training set containing 26 sample pairs was used to derive a new breast tumor intrinsic gene list. This intrinsic list contained 1300 genes and a proliferation signature that was not present in previous breast intrinsic gene sets. We tested this list as a survival predictor on a data set of 311 tumors compiled from three independent microarray studies that were fused into a single data set using Distance Weighted Discrimination. When the new intrinsic gene set was used to hierarchically cluster this combined test set, tumors were grouped into LumA, LumB, Basal-like, HER2+/ER-, and Normal Breast-like tumor subtypes that we demonstrated in previous datasets. These subtypes were associated with significant differences in Relapse-Free and Overall Survival. Multivariate Cox analysis of the combined test set showed that the intrinsic subtype classifications added significant prognostic information that was independent of standard clinical predictors. From the combined test set, we developed an objective and unchanging classifier based upon five intrinsic subtype mean expression profiles (i.e. centroids), which is designed for single sample predictions (SSP). The SSP approach was applied to two additional independent data sets and consistently predicted survival in both systemically treated and untreated patient groups.CONCLUSION:This study validates the "breast tumor intrinsic" subtype classification as an objective means of tumor classification that should be translated into a clinical assay for further retrospective and prospective validation. In addition, our method of combining existing data sets can be used to robustly validate the potential clinical value of any new gene expression profile.},

Comparing them on the same dataset that was used to derive the microarray predictor can lead to results strongly biased in favor of the microarray predictor. We propose a new technique called "pre-validation'' for making a fairer comparison between the two sets of predictors.

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION:Some patients with breast cancer develop local recurrence after breast-conservation surgery despite postoperative radiotherapy, whereas others remain free of local recurrence even in the absence of radiotherapy. As clinical parameters are insufficient for identifying these two groups of patients, we investigated whether gene expression profiling would add further information.METHODS:We performed gene expression analysis (oligonucleotide arrays, 26,824 reporters) on 143 patients with lymph node-negative disease and tumor-free margins. A support vector machine was employed to build classifiers using leave-one-out cross-validation.RESULTS:Within the estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subgroup, the gene expression profile clearly distinguished patients with local recurrence after radiotherapy (n = 20) from those without local recurrence (n = 80 with or without radiotherapy). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area was 0.91, and 5,237 of 26,824 reporters had a P value of less than 0.001 (false discovery rate = 0.005). This gene expression profile provides substantially added value to conventional clinical markers (for example, age, histological grade, and tumor size) in predicting local recurrence despite radiotherapy. Within the ER- subgroup, a weaker, but still significant, signal was found (ROC area = 0.74). The ROC area for distinguishing patients who develop local recurrence from those who remain local recurrence-free in the absence of radiotherapy was 0.66 (combined ER+/ER-).CONCLUSION:A highly distinct gene expression profile for patients developing local recurrence after breast-conservation surgery despite radiotherapy has been identified. If verified in further studies, this profile might be a most important tool in the decision making for surgery and adjuvant therapy.},

Nevertheless, a significant proportion of ER- cases have favourable outcomes and could potentially benefit from a less aggressive course of therapy. However, identification of such patients with a good prognosis remains difficult and at present is only possible through examining histopathological factors.METHODS:Building on a previously identified seven-gene prognostic immune response module for ER- breast cancer, we developed a novel statistical tool based on Mixture Discriminant Analysis in order to build a classifier that could accurately identify ER- patients with a good prognosis.RESULTS:We report the construction of a seven-gene expression classifier that accurately predicts, across a training cohort of 183 ER- tumours and six independent test cohorts (a total of 469 ER- tumours), ER- patients of good prognosis (in test sets, average predictive value = 94% [range 85 to 100%], average hazard ratio = 0.15 [range 0.07 to 0.36] p < 0.000001) independently of lymph node status and treatment.CONCLUSIONS:This seven-gene classifier could be used in a polymerase chain reaction-based clinical assay to identify ER- patients with a good prognosis, who may therefore benefit from less aggressive treatment regimens.},

@article{teschendorff2007immune,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer specimens are predominantly of high grade, have frequent p53 mutations, and are broadly divided into HER2-positive and basal subtypes. Although ER-negative disease has overall worse prognosis than does ER-positive breast cancer, not all ER-negative breast cancer patients have poor clinical outcome. Reliable identification of ER-negative tumors that have a good prognosis is not yet possible.RESULTS:We apply a recently proposed feature selection method in an integrative analysis of three major microarray expression datasets to identify molecular subclasses and prognostic markers in ER-negative breast cancer. We find a subclass of basal tumors, characterized by over-expression of immune response genes, which has a better prognosis than the rest of ER-negative breast cancers. Moreover, we show that, in contrast to ER-positive tumours, the majority of prognostic markers in ER-negative breast cancer are over-expressed in the good prognosis group and are associated with activation of complement and immune response pathways. Specifically, we identify an immune response related seven-gene module and show that downregulation of this module confers greater risk for distant metastasis (hazard ratio 2.02, 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.4; P = 0.009), independent of lymph node status and lymphocytic infiltration. Furthermore, we validate the immune response module using two additional independent datasets.CONCLUSION:We show that ER-negative basal breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with at least four main subtypes. Furthermore, we show that the heterogeneity in clinical outcome of ER-negative breast cancer is related to the variability in expression levels of complement and immune response pathway genes, independent of lymphocytic infiltration.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Previous studies demonstrated breast cancer tumor tissue samples could be classified into different subtypes based upon DNA microarray profiles. The most recent study presented evidence for the existence of five different subtypes: normal breast-like, basal, luminal A, luminal B, and ERBB2+.RESULTS:Based upon the analysis of 599 microarrays (five separate cDNA microarray datasets) using a novel approach, we present evidence in support of the most consistently identifiable subtypes of breast cancer tumor tissue microarrays being: ESR1+/ERBB2-, ESR1-/ERBB2-, and ERBB2+ (collectively called the ESR1/ERBB2 subtypes). We validate all three subtypes statistically and show the subtype to which a sample belongs is a significant predictor of overall survival and distant-metastasis free probability.CONCLUSION:As a consequence of the statistical validation procedure we have a set of centroids which can be applied to any microarray (indexed by UniGene Cluster ID) to classify it to one of the ESR1/ERBB2 subtypes. Moreover, the method used to define the ESR1/ERBB2 subtypes is not specific to the disease. The method can be used to identify subtypes in any disease for which there are at least two independent microarray datasets of disease samples.},

@article{ambrogi2006molecular,
	Abstract = {Purpose: Recent small-sized genomic studies on the identification of breast cancer bioprofiles have led to profoundly dishomogeneous results. Thus, we sought to identify distinct tumor profiles with possible clinical relevance based on clusters of immunohistochemical molecular markers measured on a large, single institution, case series.  Experimental Design: Tumor biological profiles were explored on 633 archival tissue samples analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Five validated markers were considered, i.e., estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), Ki-67/MIB1 as a proliferation marker, HER2/NEU, and p53 in their original scale of measurement. The results obtained were analyzed by three different clustering algorithms. Four different indices were then used to select the different profiles (number of clusters).  Results: The best classification was obtained creating four clusters. Notably, three clusters were identified according to low, intermediate, and high ER/PR levels. A further subdivision in two biologically distinct subtypes was determined by the presence/absence of HER2/NEU and of p53. As expected, the cluster with high ER/PR levels was characterized by a much better prognosis and response to hormone therapy compared to that with the lowest ER/PR values. Notably, the cluster characterized by high HER2/NEU levels showed intermediate prognosis, but a rather poor response to hormone therapy.  Conclusions: Our results show the possibility of profiling breast cancers by means of traditional markers, and have novel clinical implications on the definition of the prognosis of cancer patients. These findings support the existence of a tumor subtype that responds poorly to hormone therapy, characterized by HER2/NEU overexpression.

@article{thalamuthu2006evaluation,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Microarray technology has been widely applied in biological and clinical studies for simultaneous monitoring of gene expression in thousands of genes. Gene clustering analysis is found useful for discovering groups of correlated genes potentially co-regulated or associated to the disease or conditions under investigation. Many clustering methods including hierarchical clustering, K-means, PAM, SOM, mixture model-based clustering and tight clustering have been widely used in the literature. Yet no comprehensive comparative study has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods.  Results: In this paper, six gene clustering methods are evaluated by simulated data from a hierarchical log-normal model with various degrees of perturbation as well as four real datasets. A weighted Rand index is proposed for measuring similarity of two clustering results with possible scattered genes (i.e. a set of noise genes not being clustered). Performance of the methods in the real data is assessed by a predictive accuracy analysis through verified gene annotations. Our results show that tight clustering and model-based clustering consistently outperform other clustering methods both in simulated and real data while hierarchical clustering and SOM perform among the worst. Our analysis provides deep insight to the complicated gene clustering problem of expression profile and serves as a practical guideline for routine microarray cluster analysis.

@article{tseng2005tight,
	Abstract = {In this article, we propose a method for clustering that produces tight and stable clusters without forcing all points into clusters. The methodology is general but was initially motivated from cluster analysis of microarray experiments. Most current algorithms aim to assign all genes into clusters. For many biological studies, however, we are mainly interested in identifying the most informative, tight, and stable clusters of sizes, say, 20-60 genes for further investigation. We want to avoid the contamination of tightly regulated expression patterns of biologically relevant genes due to other genes whose expressions are only loosely compatible with these patterns. "Tight clustering" has been developed specifically to address this problem. It applies K-means clustering as an intermediate clustering engine. Early truncation of a hierarchical clustering tree is used to overcome the local minimum problem in K-means clustering. The tightest and most stable clusters are identified in a sequential manner through an analysis of the tendency of genes to be grouped together under repeated resampling. We validated this method in a simulated example and applied it to analyze a set of expression profiles in the study of embryonic stem cells.},

@article{lusa2007challenges,
	Abstract = {BackgroundGene expression microarray studies for several types of cancer have been reported to identify previously unknown subtypes of tumors. For breast cancer, a molecular classification consisting of five subtypes based on gene expression microarray data has been proposed. These subtypes have been reported to exist across several breast cancer microarray studies, and they have demonstrated some association with clinical outcome. A classification rule based on the method of centroids has been proposed for identifying the subtypes in new collections of breast cancer samples; the method is based on the similarity of the new profiles to the mean expression profile of the previously identified subtypes.  MethodsPreviously identified centroids of five breast cancer subtypes were used to assign 99 breast cancer samples, including a subset of 65 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) samples, to five breast cancer subtypes based on microarray data for the samples. The effect of mean centering the genes (i.e., transforming the expression of each gene so that its mean expression is equal to 0) on subtype assignment by method of centroids was assessed. Further studies of the effect of mean centering and of class prevalence in the test set on the accuracy of method of centroids classifications of ER status were carried out using training and test sets for which ER status had been independently determined by ligand-binding assay and for which the proportion of ER+ and ER- samples were systematically varied.  ResultsWhen all 99 samples were considered, mean centering before application of the method of centroids appeared to be helpful for correctly assigning samples to subtypes, as evidenced by the expression of genes that had previously been used as markers to identify the subtypes. However, when only the 65 ER+ samples were considered for classification, many samples appeared to be misclassified, as evidenced by an unexpected distribution of ER+ samples among the resultant subtypes. When genes were mean centered before classification of samples for ER status, the accuracy of the ER subgroup assignments was highly dependent on the proportion of ER+ samples in the test set; this effect of subtype prevalence was not seen when gene expression data were not mean centered.  ConclusionsSimple corrections such as mean centering of genes aimed at microarray platform or batch effect correction can have undesirable consequences because patient population effects can easily be confused with these assay-related effects. Careful thought should be given to the comparability of the patient populations before attempting to force data comparability for purposes of assigning subtypes to independent subjects.

@article{buyse2006validation,
	Abstract = {Background: A 70-gene signature was previously shown to have prognostic value in patients with node-negative breast cancer. Our goal was to validate the signature in an independent group of patients. Methods: Patients (n = 307, with 137 events after a median follow-up of 13.6 years) from five European centers were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on the gene signature classification and on clinical risk classifications. Patients were assigned to the gene signature low-risk group if their 5-year distant metastasis-free survival probability as estimated by the gene signature was greater than 90%. Patients were assigned to the clinicopathologic low-risk group if their 10-year survival probability, as estimated by Adjuvant! software, was greater than 88% (for estrogen receptor [ER]-positive patients) or 92% (for ER-negative patients). Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated to compare time to distant metastases, disease-free survival, and overall survival in high- versus low-risk groups. Results: The 70-gene signature outperformed the clinicopathologic risk assessment in predicting all endpoints. For time to distant metastases, the gene signature yielded HR = 2.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.35 to 4.00) without adjustment for clinical risk and hazard ratios ranging from 2.13 to 2.15 after adjustment for various estimates of clinical risk; clinicopathologic risk using Adjuvant! software yielded an unadjusted HR = 1.68 (95% CI = 0.92 to 3.07). For overall survival, the gene signature yielded an unadjusted HR = 2.79 (95% CI = 1.60 to 4.87) and adjusted hazard ratios ranging from 2.63 to 2.89; clinicopathologic risk yielded an unadjusted HR = 1.67 (95% CI = 0.93 to 2.98). For patients in the gene signature high-risk group, 10-year overall survival was 0.69 for patients in both the low- and high-clinical risk groups; for patients in the gene signature low-risk group, the 10-year survival rates were 0.88 and 0.89, respectively. Conclusions: The 70-gene signature adds independent prognostic information to clinicopathologic risk assessment for patients with early breast cancer.

@article{conforti2007breast,
	Abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive value of breast cancer molecular subclassification regarding the benefit of adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy.  Patients and methods: Tumor samples from 823 patients included in two randomized trials that compared an anthracycline-based chemotherapy with no treatment were used to construct a tissue array. Estrogen receptor (ER), Her2, epidermal growth factor receptor, cytokeratine 5/6 expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The potential predictive factors of treatment effect on disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed by interaction tests and multivariate analysis.  Results: Sixty-four (8%), 98 (12%), 109 (14%) and 527 (66%) patients presented a Her2+/ER-, basal-like, Her2-/ER-/nonbasal and luminal-like breast cancer. ER expression, when assessed by IHC, was an independent predictive factor for the benefit of chemotherapy on DFS (test for interaction, P = 0.0015). The molecular subclassification significantly predicted the efficacy of chemotherapy (test for interaction, P = 0.01), but had no significant added value (P = 0.32) as compared to the ER by treatment interaction. Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio for relapse or death of 0.42 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-1.05], 0.54 (95% CI: 0.27-1.08), 0.35 (95% CI: 0.18-0.68), 1.07 (95% CI: 0.81-1.41) for patients with Her2+/ER-, basal-like, Her2-/ER-/nonbasal and luminal-like tumors, respectively.  Conclusion: The breast cancer molecular subclassification was predictive for chemotherapy efficacy in adjuvant setting, but did not provide significant additional information to ER.

@article{sihto2008molecular,
	Abstract = {Purpose: The frequency and significance of gene expression profile-derived molecular subtypes of breast cancers found in mammography screening are unknown.  Experimental Design: We identified breast cancers diagnosed in women of any age living in defined geographic regions in Finland in 1991 to 1992 and collected clinical and pathologic data. Surrogates for the molecular subtypes were determined for 247 cancers found in organized mammography screening and 989 cancers detected outside of screening using immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization. Molecular subtypes were defined as luminal A [estrogen receptor (ER) positive and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive, HER2-], luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2+), basal-like (ER-, PR-, HER2-, cytokeratin 5+, and/or HER1+), HER2+/ER- (ER-, PR-, and HER2+), and unclassified. The median follow-up time was 9.4 years.  Results: The luminal type A was common (73.7%) and the HER2+/ER- type is rare (5.7%) in screen-detected cancer, and only 16% were HER2 positive. Women with cancer diagnosed in screening at ages 50 to 69 years had similar molecular subtype distribution as women whose cancer was found outside of screening at age >69 years. In a multivariate model, cancer detection at screening independently predicted favorable distant disease-free survival when the molecular subtype was included as a covariate in addition to age, histologic grade, and cancer size. Women with small (pT1N0M0) HER2-positive cancer had similar outcome regardless of the method of detection.  Conclusions: Molecular subtype distribution of screen-detected breast cancer differs from that of cancers found outside of screening and accounts in part for the better outcome of screen-detected cancer.

@article{calza2006intrinsic,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Molecular markers and the rich biological information they contain have great potential for cancer diagnosis, prognostication and therapy prediction. So far, however, they have not superseded routine histopathology and staging criteria, partly because the few studies performed on molecular subtyping have had little validation and limited clinical characterization.METHODS:We obtained gene expression and clinical data for 412 breast cancers obtained from population-based cohorts of patients from Stockholm and Uppsala, Sweden. Using the intrinsic set of approximately 500 genes derived in the Norway/Stanford breast cancer data, we validated the existence of five molecular subtypes - basal-like, ERBB2, luminal A/B and normal-like - and characterized these subtypes extensively with the use of conventional clinical variables.RESULTS:We found an overall 77.5% concordance between the centroid prediction of the Swedish cohort by using the Norway/Stanford signature and the k-means clustering performed internally within the Swedish cohort. The highest rate of discordant assignments occurred between the luminal A and luminal B subtypes and between the luminal B and ERBB2 subtypes. The subtypes varied significantly in terms of grade (p < 0.001), p53 mutation (p < 0.001) and genomic instability (p = 0.01), but surprisingly there was little difference in lymph-node metastasis (p = 0.31). Furthermore, current users of hormone-replacement therapy were strikingly over-represented in the normal-like subgroup (p < 0.001). Separate analyses of the patients who received endocrine therapy and those who did not receive any adjuvant therapy supported the previous hypothesis that the basal-like subtype responded to adjuvant treatment, whereas the ERBB2 and luminal B subtypes were poor responders.CONCLUSION:We found that the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer are broadly present in a diverse collection of patients from a population-based cohort in Sweden. The intrinsic gene set, originally selected to reveal stable tumor characteristics, was shown to have a strong correlation with progression-related properties such as grade, p53 mutation and genomic instability.},

@article{pusztai2006molecular,
	Abstract = {Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and DNA microarrays are increasingly used in the clinic and in clinical research as prognostic or predictive tests. Results from these tests led to novel risk stratification methods and to new molecular classification of breast cancer. Some of these tools already complement existing diagnostic tests and can aid medical decision making in some situations. Better understanding of the molecular classes of breast cancer, independent of their prognostic and predictive values, may also lead to new biological insights and eventually to better therapies that are directed toward particular molecular subsets. However, there is substantially less experience with these emerging technologies than with the more established methods, the accuracy of which is often overestimated. This review discusses some of the limitations and strengths of current gene expression-based molecular classification of breast cancer. To provide context for this discussion, we also briefly examine the performance of estrogen receptor immunohistochemistry, which represents an essential part of the routine diagnostic workup for all breast cancer patients.

@article{ambroise2002selection,
	Abstract = {In the context of cancer diagnosis and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.

@article{wessels2005protocol,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Microarray gene expression data are increasingly employed to identify sets of marker genes that accurately predict disease development and outcome in cancer. Many computational approaches have been proposed to construct such predictors. However, there is, as yet, no objective way to evaluate whether a new approach truly improves on the current state of the art. In addition no  standard' computational approach has emerged which enables robust outcome prediction.  Results: An important contribution of this work is the description of a principled training and validation protocol, which allows objective evaluation of the complete methodology for constructing a predictor. We review the possible choices of computational approaches, with specific emphasis on predictor choice and reporter selection strategies. Employing this training-validation protocol, we evaluated different reporter selection strategies and predictors on six gene expression datasets of varying degrees of difficulty. We demonstrate that simple reporter selection strategies (forward filtering and shrunken centroids) work surprisingly well and outperform partial least squares in four of the six datasets. Similarly, simple predictors, such as the nearest mean classifier, outperform more complex classifiers. Our training-validation protocol provides a robust methodology to evaluate the performance of new computational approaches and to objectively compare outcome predictions on different datasets.

@article{schmidt2008humoral,
	Abstract = {Estrogen receptor (ER) expression and proliferative activity are established prognostic factors in breast cancer. In a search for additional prognostic motifs, we analyzed the gene expression patterns of 200 tumors of patients who were not treated by systemic therapy after surgery using a discovery approach. After performing hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified coregulated genes related to the biological process of proliferation, steroid hormone receptor expression, as well as B-cell and T-cell infiltration. We calculated metagenes as a surrogate for all genes contained within a particular cluster and visualized the relative expression in relation to time to metastasis with principal component analysis. Distinct patterns led to the hypothesis of a prognostic role of the immune system in tumors with high expression of proliferation-associated genes. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the proliferation metagene showed a significant association with metastasis-free survival of the whole discovery cohort [hazard ratio (HR), 2.20; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.40-3.46]. The B-cell metagene showed additional independent prognostic information in carcinomas with high proliferative activity (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.97). A prognostic influence of the B-cell metagene was independently confirmed by multivariate analysis in a first validation cohort enriched for high-grade tumors (n = 286; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.98) and a second validation cohort enriched for younger patients (n = 302; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.7-0.97). Thus, we could show in three cohorts of untreated, node-negative breast cancer patients that the humoral immune system plays a pivotal role in metastasis-free survival of carcinomas of the breast.

@article{dupuy2007critical,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both the validity and the reproducibility of microarray-based clinical research have been challenged. There is a need for critical review of the statistical analysis and reporting in published microarray studies that focus on cancer-related clinical outcomes.  METHODS: Studies published through 2004 in which microarray-based gene expression profiles were analyzed for their relation to a clinical cancer outcome were identified through a Medline search followed by hand screening of abstracts and full text articles. Studies that were eligible for our analysis addressed one or more outcomes that were either an event occurring during follow-up, such as death or relapse, or a therapeutic response. We recorded descriptive characteristics for all the selected studies. A critical review of outcome-related statistical analyses was undertaken for the articles published in 2004.  RESULTS: Ninety studies were identified, and their descriptive characteristics are presented. Sixty-eight (76%) were published in journals of impact factor greater than 6. A detailed account of the 42 studies (47%) published in 2004 is reported. Twenty-one (50%) of them contained at least one of the following three basic flaws: 1) in outcome-related gene finding, an unstated, unclear, or inadequate control for multiple testing; 2) in class discovery, a spurious claim of correlation between clusters and clinical outcome, made after clustering samples using a selection of outcome-related differentially expressed genes; or 3) in supervised prediction, a biased estimation of the prediction accuracy through an incorrect cross-validation procedure.  CONCLUSIONS: The most common and serious mistakes and misunderstandings recorded in published studies are described and illustrated. Based on this analysis, a proposal of guidelines for statistical analysis and reporting for clinical microarray studies, presented as a checklist of "Do's and Don'ts," is provided.

@article{zupan1999machine,
	Abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of learning prognostic models from medical survival data, where the sole prediction of probability of event (and not its probability dependency on time) is of interest. To appropriately consider the follow-up time and censoring --- both characteristic for survival data --- we propose a weighting technique that lessens the impact of data from patients for which the event did not occur and have short follow-up times. A case study on prostate cancer recurrence shows that by incorporating this weighting technique the machine learning tools stand beside or even outperform modern statistical methods and may, by inducing symbolic recurrence models, provide further insight to relationships within the modeled data. },

A satisfactory correlation of histopathological grades assessed by three pathologists was found in 72.3% of all cases. Fifteen cases (9%) were over- and 31 cases (18.7%) were underestimated compared with an expert's grade. A disagreement of two grades occurred in one case only. In comparison of grade 1 and grade 3 tumours as well as of grade 2 and grade 3 tumours significant differences in the overall survival could be found. Irrespective of statistically significant differences between the three grades in actuarial survival, the histopathological grading is of rather low value for the prediction of prognosis of individual patients.},

	Abstract = {In many areas of molecular biology there is a need to rapidly extract and analyze genetic information; however, current technologies for DNA sequence analysis are slow and labor intensive. We report here how modern photolithographic techniques can be used to facilitate sequence analysis by generating miniaturized arrays of densely packed oligonucleotide probes. These probe arrays, or DNA chips, can then be applied to parallel DNA hybridization analysis, directly yielding sequence information. In a preliminary experiment, a 1.28 x 1.28 cm array of 256 different octanucleotides was produced in 16 chemical reaction cycles, requiring 4 hr to complete. The hybridization pattern of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide targets was then detected by epifluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence signals from complementary probes were 5-35 times stronger than those with single or double base-pair hybridization mismatches, demonstrating specificity in the identification of complementary sequences. This method should prove to be a powerful tool for rapid investigations in human genetics and diagnostics, pathogen detection, and DNA molecular recognition.},

RNA expression data were generated in seven laboratories, which compared two standard RNA samples using 12 microarray platforms. At least two standard microarray types (one spotted, one commercial) were used by all laboratories. Reproducibility for most platforms within any laboratory was typically good, but reproducibility between platforms and across laboratories was generally poor. Reproducibility between laboratories increased markedly when standardized protocols were implemented for RNA labeling, hybridization, microarray processing, data acquisition and data normalization. Reproducibility was highest when analysis was based on biological themes defined by enriched Gene Ontology (GO) categories. These findings indicate that microarray results can be comparable across multiple laboratories, especially when a common platform and set of procedures are used.},

@article{johnson2007adjusting,
	Abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ([IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0">) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice. Software for our method is freely available at: http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/batch/.

@article{gevaert2006predicting,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Clinical data, such as patient history, laboratory analysis, ultrasound parameters--which are the basis of day-to-day clinical decision support--are often underused to guide the clinical management of cancer in the presence of microarray data. We propose a strategy based on Bayesian networks to treat clinical and microarray data on an equal footing. The main advantage of this probabilistic model is that it allows to integrate these data sources in several ways and that it allows to investigate and understand the model structure and parameters. Furthermore using the concept of a Markov Blanket we can identify all the variables that shield off the class variable from the influence of the remaining network. Therefore Bayesian networks automatically perform feature selection by identifying the (in)dependency relationships with the class variable.  Results: We evaluated three methods for integrating clinical and microarray data: decision integration, partial integration and full integration and used them to classify publicly available data on breast cancer patients into a poor and a good prognosis group. The partial integration method is most promising and has an independent test set area under the ROC curve of 0.845. After choosing an operating point the classification performance is better than frequently used indices.  Contact: olivier.gevaert@esat.kuleuven.be

@article{boulesteix2008microarraybased,
	Abstract = {Motivation: In the context of clinical bioinformatics methods are needed for assessing the additional predictive value of microarray data compared to simple clinical parameters alone. Such methods should also provide an optimal prediction rule making use of all potentialities of both types of data: they should ideally be able to catch subtypes which are not identified by clinical parameters alone. Moreover, they should address the question of the additional predictive value of microarray data in a fair framework.  Results: We propose a novel but simple two-step approach based on random forests and partial least squares (PLS) dimension reduction embedding the idea of pre-validation suggested by Tibshirani and colleagues, which is based on an internal cross-validation for avoiding overfitting. Our approach is fast, flexible and can be used both for assessing the overall additional significance of the microarray data and for building optimal hybrid classification rules. Its efficiency is demonstrated through simulations and an application to breast cancer and colorectal cancer data.

@article{boulesteix2007wilcoxcv,
	Abstract = {Summary: In the last few years, numerous methods have been proposed for microarray-based class prediction. Although many of them have been designed especially for the case n << p (much more variables than observations), preliminary variable selection is almost always necessary when the number of genes reaches several tens of thousands, as usual in recent data sets. In the two-class setting, the Wilcoxon rank sum test statistic is, with the t-statistic, one of the standard approaches for variable selection. It is well known that the variable selection step must be seen as a part of classifier construction and, as such, be performed based on training data only. When classifier accuracy is evaluated via cross-validation or Monte-Carlo cross-validation, it means that we have to perform p Wilcoxon or t-tests for each iteration, which becomes a daunting task for increasing p. As a consequence, many authors often perform variable selection only once using all the available data, which can induce a dramatic underestimation of error rate and thus lead to misleadingly reporting predictive power. We propose a very fast implementation of variable selection based on the Wilcoxon test for use in cross-validation and Monte Carlo cross-validation (also known as random splitting into learning and test sets). This implementation is based on a simple mathematical formula using only the ranks calculated from the original data set.

@article{braganeto2004crossvalidation,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Microarray classification typically possesses two striking attributes: (1) classifier design and error estimation are based on remarkably small samples and (2) cross-validation error estimation is employed in the majority of the papers. Thus, it is necessary to have a quantifiable understanding of the behavior of cross-validation in the context of very small samples.  Results: An extensive simulation study has been performed comparing cross-validation, resubstitution and bootstrap estimation for three popular classification rules--linear discriminant analysis, 3-nearest-neighbor and decision trees (CART)--using both synthetic and real breast-cancer patient data. Comparison is via the distribution of differences between the estimated and true errors. Various statistics for the deviation distribution have been computed: mean (for estimator bias), variance (for estimator precision), root-mean square error (for composition of bias and variance) and quartile ranges, including outlier behavior. In general, while cross-validation error estimation is much less biased than resubstitution, it displays excessive variance, which makes individual estimates unreliable for small samples. Bootstrap methods provide improved performance relative to variance, but at a high computational cost and often with increased bias (albeit, much less than with resubstitution).  Availability and Supplementary information: A companion web site can be accessed at the URL http://ee.tamu.edu/~edward/cv_paper.

@article{statnikov2005comprehensive,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Cancer diagnosis is one of the most important emerging clinical applications of gene expression microarray technology. We are seeking to develop a computer system for powerful and reliable cancer diagnostic model creation based on microarray data. To keep a realistic perspective on clinical applications we focus on multicategory diagnosis. To equip the system with the optimum combination of classifier, gene selection and cross-validation methods, we performed a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of several major algorithms for multicategory classification, several gene selection methods, multiple ensemble classifier methods and two cross-validation designs using 11 datasets spanning 74 diagnostic categories and 41 cancer types and 12 normal tissue types.  Results: Multicategory support vector machines (MC-SVMs) are the most effective classifiers in performing accurate cancer diagnosis from gene expression data. The MC-SVM techniques by Crammer and Singer, Weston and Watkins and one-versus-rest were found to be the best methods in this domain. MC-SVMs outperform other popular machine learning algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors, backpropagation and probabilistic neural networks, often to a remarkable degree. Gene selection techniques can significantly improve the classification performance of both MC-SVMs and other non-SVM learning algorithms. Ensemble classifiers do not generally improve performance of the best non-ensemble models. These results guided the construction of a software system GEMS (Gene Expression Model Selector) that automates high-quality model construction and enforces sound optimization and performance estimation procedures. This is the first such system to be informed by a rigorous comparative analysis of the available algorithms and datasets.  Availability: The software system GEMS is available for download from http://www.gems-system.org for non-commercial use.  Contact: alexander.statnikov@vanderbilt.edu

@article{brown2000knowledgebased,
	Abstract = {We introduce a method of functionally classifying genes by using gene expression data from DNA microarray hybridization experiments. The method is based on the theory of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are considered a supervised computer learning method because they exploit prior knowledge of gene function to identify unknown genes of similar function from expression data. SVMs avoid several problems associated with unsupervised clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps. SVMs have many mathematical features that make them attractive for gene expression analysis, including their flexibility in choosing a similarity function, sparseness of solution when dealing with large data sets, the ability to handle large feature spaces, and the ability to identify outliers. We test several SVMs that use different similarity metrics, as well as some other supervised learning methods, and find that the SVMs best identify sets of genes with a common function using expression data. Finally, we use SVMs to predict functional roles for uncharacterized yeast ORFs based on their expression data.

@article{khan1998gene,
	Abstract = {Several forms of human sarcoma, lymphoma, and leukemia are characterized by somatically acquired chromosome translocations that result in fusion genes that encode chimeric transcription factors with oncogenic properties. We have used cDNA microarrays containing 1238 cDNAs to investigate the gene expression profile of a group of seven alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) cell lines characterized by the presence of the PAX3-FKHR fusion gene. Using the method of multidimensional scaling to represent the relationships among the cell lines in two-dimensional Euclidean space, we determined that ARMS cells show a consistent pattern of gene expression, which allows the cells to be clustered together. By searching across the seven ARMS cell lines, we found that 37 of 1238 genes were most consistently expressed in ARMS relative to a reference cell line. Only three of these genes have been previously reported to be expressed in ARMS. Among these 37 were genes related to both primary (PAX3-FKHR) and secondary (CDK4) genetic alterations in ARMS. These results in ARMS demonstrate the potential of cDNA microarray technology to elucidate tumor-specific gene expression profiles in human cancers.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Chemotherapy for operable breast cancer decreases the risk of death. Docetaxel is one of the most active agents in breast cancer, but resistance or incomplete response is frequent.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Core biopsies from 24 patients were obtained before treatment with neoadjuvant docetaxel (four cycles, 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks), and response was assessed after chemotherapy. After 3 months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical specimens (n = 13) were obtained, and laser capture microdissection (LCM; n = 8) was performed to enrich for tumor cells. From each core, surgical, and LCM specimen, sufficient total RNA (3 to 6 {micro}g) was extracted for cDNA array analysis using the Affymetrix HgU95-Av2 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).  RESULTS: From the initial core biopsies, differential patterns of expression of 92 genes correlated with docetaxel response (P = .001). However, the molecular patterns of the residual cancers after 3 months of docetaxel treatment were strikingly similar, independent of initial sensitivity or resistance. This relative genetic homogeneity after treatment was observed in both LCM and non-LCM surgical specimens. The residual tumor after treatment in tumors that were initially sensitive indicates selection of a residual and resistant subpopulation of cells. The gene expression pattern was populated by genes involved in cell cycle arrest at G2M (eg, mitotic cyclins and cdc2) and survival pathways involving the mammalian target of rapamycin.  CONCLUSION: A specific and consistent gene expression pattern was found in residual tumors after docetaxel treatment. These profiles provide therapeutic targets that could lead to improved treatment.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to examine the feasibility of developing a multigene predictor of pathologic complete response (pCR) to sequential weekly paclitaxel and fluorouracil + doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide (T/FAC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for breast cancer.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients underwent one-time pretreatment fine-needle aspiration to obtain RNA from the cancer for transcriptional profiling using cDNA arrays containing 30,721 human sequence clones. Analysis was performed after profiling, and 42 patients' clinical results were available, 24 of which were used for predictive marker discovery; 18 patients' results were used as an independent validation set.  RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of patients had pCR (six discovery and seven validation), defined as disappearance of all invasive cancer in the breast after completion of chemotherapy. We could identify no single marker that was sufficiently associated with pCR to be used as an individual predictor. A multigene model with 74 markers (P [&le;] .09) was built using data from the discovery samples and tested on the validation samples. Overall, a 78% (14 of 18) predictive accuracy was observed, with a 100% (three of three) positive predictive value for pCR, a 73% (11 of 15) negative predictive value, a sensitivity of 43% (three of seven), and a specificity of 100% (11 of 11). The expected response rate to T/FAC neoadjuvant therapy in unselected patients is 28%.  CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that transcriptional profiling has the potential to identify a gene expression pattern in breast cancer that may lead to clinically useful predictors of pCR to T/FAC neoadjuvant therapy.

@article{ma2008fivegene,
	Abstract = {Purpose: Histologic tumor grade is a well-established prognostic factor for breast cancer, and tumor grade-associated genes are the common denominator of many prognostic gene signatures. The objectives of this study are as follows: (a) to develop a simple gene expression index for tumor grade (molecular grade index or MGI), and (b) to determine whether MGI and our previously described HOXB13:IL17BR index together provide improved prognostic information.  Experimental Design: From our previously published list of genes whose expression correlates with both tumor grade and tumor stage progression, we selected five cell cycle-related genes to build MGI and evaluated MGI in two publicly available microarray data sets totaling 410 patients. Using two additional cohorts (n = 323), we developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR assay for MGI, validated its prognostic utility, and examined its interaction with HOXB13:IL17BR.  Results: MGI performed consistently as a strong prognostic factor and was comparable with a more complex 97-gene genomic grade index in multiple data sets. In patients treated with endocrine therapy, MGI and HOXB13:IL17BR modified each other's prognostic performance. High MGI was associated with significantly worse outcome only in combination with high HOXB13:IL17BR, and likewise, high HOXB13:IL17BR was significantly associated with poor outcome only in combination with high MGI.  Conclusions: We developed and validated a five-gene reverse transcription PCR assay for MGI suitable for analyzing routine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical samples. The combination of MGI and HOXB13:IL17BR outperforms either alone and identifies a subgroup ([~]30%) of early stage estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients with very poor outcome despite endocrine therapy.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:When developing multivariable regression models for diagnosis or prognosis, continuous independent variables can be categorized to make a prediction table instead of a prediction formula. Although many methods have been proposed to dichotomize prognostic variables, to date there has been no integrated method for polychotomization. The latter is necessary when dichotomization results in too much loss of information or when central values refer to normal states and more dispersed values refer to less preferable states, a situation that is not unusual in medical settings (e.g. body temperature, blood pressure). The goal of our study was to develop a theoretical and practical method for polychotomization.METHODS:We used the overall discrimination index C, introduced by Harrel, as a measure of the predictive ability of an independent regressor variable and derived a method for polychotomization mathematically. Since the naive application of our method, like some existing methods, gives rise to positive bias, we developed a parametric method that minimizes this bias and assessed its performance by the use of Monte Carlo simulation.RESULTS:The overall C is closely related to the area under the ROC curve and the produced di(poly)chotomized variable's predictive performance is comparable to the original continuous variable. The simulation shows that the parametric method is essentially unbiased for both the estimates of performance and the cutoff points. Application of our method to the predictor variables of a previous study on rhabdomyolysis shows that it can be used to make probability profile tables that are applicable to the diagnosis or prognosis of individual patient status.CONCLUSION:We propose a polychotomization (including dichotomization) method for independent continuous variables in regression models based on the overall discrimination index C and clarified its meaning mathematically. To avoid positive bias in application, we have proposed and evaluated a parametric method. The proposed method for polychotomizing continuous regressor variables performed well and can be used to create probability profile tables.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of the computer program Adjuvant! is to allow health professionals and their patients with early breast cancer to make more informed decisions about adjuvant therapy.  METHODS: Actuarial analysis was used to project outcomes of patients with and without adjuvant therapy based on estimates of prognosis largely derived from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results data and estimates of the efficacy of adjuvant therapy based on the 1998 overviews of randomized trials of adjuvant therapy. These estimates can be refined using the Prognostic Factor Impact Calculator, which uses a Bayesian method to make adjustments based on relative risks conferred and prevalence of positive test results.  RESULTS: From the entries of patient information (age, menopausal status, comorbidity estimate) and tumor staging and characteristics (tumor size, number of positive axillary nodes, estrogen receptor status), baseline prognostic estimates are made. Estimates for the efficacy of endocrine therapy (5 years of tamoxifen) and of polychemotherapy (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil-like regimens, or anthracycline-based therapy, or therapy based on both an anthracycline and a taxane) can then be used to project outcomes presented in both numerical and graphical formats. Outcomes for overall survival and disease-free survival and the improvement seen in clinical trials, are reasonably modeled by Adjuvant!, although an ideal validation for all patient subsets with all treatment options is not possible. Additional speculative estimates of years of remaining life expectancy and long-term survival curves can also be produced. Help files supply general information about breast cancer. The program's Internet links supply national treatment guidelines, cooperative group trial options, and other related information.  CONCLUSION: The computer program Adjuvant! can play practical and educational roles in clinical settings.

@article{xu2008merging,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:There is an urgent need for new prognostic markers of breast cancer metastases to ensure that newly diagnosed patients receive appropriate therapy. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential value of gene expression signatures in assessing the risk of developing distant metastases. However, due to the small sample sizes of individual studies, the overlap among signatures is almost zero and their predictive power is often limited. Integrating microarray data from multiple studies in order to increase sample size is therefore a promising approach to the development of more robust prognostic tests.RESULTS:In this study, by using a highly stable data aggregation procedure based on expression comparisons, we have integrated three independent microarray gene expression data sets for breast cancer and identified a structured prognostic signature consisting of 112 genes organized into 80 pair-wise expression comparisons. A classical likelihood ratio test based on these comparisons, essentially weighted voting, achieves 88.6% sensitivity and 54.6% specificity in an independent external test set of 154 samples. The test is highly informative in assessing the risk of developing distant metastases within five years (hazard ratio 9.3 with 95% CI 2.9-29.9).CONCLUSION:Rank-based features provide a stable way to integrate patient data from separate microarray studies due to invariance to data normalization, and such features can be combined into a useful predictor of distant metastases in breast cancer within a statistical modeling framework which begins to capture gene-gene interactions. Upon further confirmation on large-scale independent data, such prognostic signatures and tests could provide a powerful tool to guide adjuvant systemic treatment that could greatly reduce the cost of breast cancer treatment, both in terms of toxic side effects and health care expenditures.},

@article{chanrion2008gene,
	Abstract = {Purpose: The identification of a molecular signature predicting the relapse of tamoxifen-treated primary breast cancers should help the therapeutic management of estrogen receptor-positive cancers.  Experimental Design: A series of 132 primary tumors from patients who received adjuvant tamoxifen were analyzed for expression profiles at the whole-genome level by 70-mer oligonucleotide microarrays. A supervised analysis was done to identify an expression signature.  Results: We defined a 36-gene signature that correctly classified 78% of patients with relapse and 80% of relapse-free patients (79% accuracy). Using 23 independent tumors, we confirmed the accuracy of the signature (78%) whose relevance was further shown by using published microarray data from 60 tamoxifen-treated patients (63% accuracy). Univariate analysis using the validation set of 83 tumors showed that the 36-gene classifier is more efficient in predicting disease-free survival than the traditional histopathologic prognostic factors and is as effective as the Nottingham Prognostic Index or the "Adjuvant!" software. Multivariate analysis showed that the molecular signature is the only independent prognostic factor. A comparison with several already published signatures demonstrated that the 36-gene signature is among the best to classify tumors from both training and validation sets. Kaplan-Meier analyses emphasized its prognostic power both on the whole cohort of patients and on a subgroup with an intermediate risk of recurrence as defined by the St. Gallen criteria.  Conclusion: This study identifies a molecular signature specifying a subgroup of patients who do not gain benefits from tamoxifen treatment. These patients may therefore be eligible for alternative endocrine therapies and/or chemotherapy.

@article{hoadley2007egfr,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER1) and its downstream signaling events are important for regulating cell growth and behavior in many epithelial tumors types. In breast cancer, the role of EGFR is complex and appears to vary relative to important clinical features including estrogen receptor (ER) status. To investigate EGFR-signaling using a genomics approach, several breast basal-like and luminal epithelial cell lines were examined for sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. An EGFR-associated gene expression signature was identified in the basal-like SUM102 cell line and was used to classify a diverse set of sporadic breast tumors.RESULTS:In vitro, breast basal-like cell lines were more sensitive to EGFR inhibitors compared to luminal cell lines. The basal-like tumor derived lines were also the most sensitive to carboplatin, which acted synergistically with cetuximab. An EGFR-associated signature was developed in vitro, evaluated on 241 primary breast tumors; three distinct clusters of genes were evident in vivo, two of which were predictive of poor patient outcomes. These EGFR-associated poor prognostic signatures were highly expressed in almost all basal-like tumors and many of the HER2+/ER- and Luminal B tumors.CONCLUSION:These results suggest that breast basal-like cell lines are sensitive to EGFR inhibitors and carboplatin, and this combination may also be synergistic. In vivo, the EGFR-signatures were of prognostic value, were associated with tumor subtype, and were uniquely associated with the high expression of distinct EGFR-RAS-MEK pathway genes.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION:Breast cancer is a heterogeneous group of tumors, and can be subdivided on the basis of histopathological features, genetic alterations and gene-expression profiles. One well-defined subtype of breast cancer is characterized by a lack of HER2 gene amplification and estrogen and progesterone receptor expression ('triple-negative tumors'). We examined the histopathological and gene-expression profile of triple-negative tumors to define subgroups with specific characteristics, including risk of developing distant metastases.METHODS:97 triple-negative tumors were selected from the fresh-frozen tissue bank of the Netherlands Cancer Institute, and gene-expression profiles were generated using 35K oligonucleotide microarrays. In addition, histopathological and immunohistochemical characterization was performed, and the findings were associated to clinical features.RESULTS:All triple-negative tumors were classified as basal-like tumors on the basis of their overall gene-expression profile. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed five distinct subgroups of triple-negative breast cancers. Multivariable analysis showed that a large amount of lymphocytic infiltrate (HR = 0.30, 95% CI 0.09-0.96) and absence of central fibrosis in the tumors (HR = 0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.62) were associated with distant metastasis-free survival.CONCLUSION:Triple-negative tumors are synonymous with basal-like tumors, and can be identified by immunohistochemistry. Based on gene-expression profiling, basal-like tumors are still heterogeneous and can be subdivided into at least five distinct subgroups. The development of distant metastasis in basal-like tumors is associated with the presence of central fibrosis and a small amount of lymphocytic infiltrate.},

	Abstract = {Profiling breast cancer with expression arrays has become common, and it has been suggested that the results from early studies will lead to understanding of the molecular differences between clinical cases and allow individualization of care. We critically review two main applications of expression profiling; studies unraveling novel breast cancer classifications and those that aim to identify novel markers for prediction of clinical outcome. Breast cancer may now be subclassified into luminal, basal, and HER2 subtypes with distinct differences in prognosis and response to therapy. However, profiling studies to identify predictive markers have suffered from methodologic problems that prevent general application of their results. Future work will need to reanalyze existing microarray data sets to identify more representative sets of candidate genes for use as prognostic signatures and will need to take into account the new knowledge of molecular subtypes of breast cancer when assessing predictive effects.},

	Abstract = {Predicting at the time of discovery the prognosis and metastatic potential of cancer is a major challenge in current clinical research. Numerous recent studies searched for gene expression signatures that outperform traditionally used clinical parameters in outcome prediction. Finding such a signature will free many patients of the suffering and toxicity associated with adjuvant chemotherapy given to them under current protocols, even though they do not need such treatment. A reliable set of predictive genes also will contribute to a better understanding of the biological mechanism of metastasis. Several groups have published lists of predictive genes and reported good predictive performance based on them. However, the gene lists obtained for the same clinical types of patients by different groups differed widely and had only very few genes in common. This lack of agreement raised doubts about the reliability and robustness of the reported predictive gene lists, and the main source of the problem was shown to be the small number of samples that were used to generate the gene lists. Here, we introduce a previously undescribed mathematical method, probably approximately correct (PAC) sorting, for evaluating the robustness of such lists. We calculate for several published data sets the number of samples that are needed to achieve any desired level of reproducibility. For example, to achieve a typical overlap of 50% between two predictive lists of genes, breast cancer studies would need the expression profiles of several thousand early discovery patients.

@article{minn2007lung,
	Abstract = {The association between large tumor size and metastatic risk in a majority of clinical cancers has led to questions as to whether these observations are causally related or whether one is simply a marker for the other. This is partly due to an uncertainty about how metastasis-promoting gene expression changes can arise in primary tumors. We investigated this question through the analysis of a previously defined "lung metastasis gene-expression signature" (LMS) that mediates experimental breast cancer metastasis selectively to the lung and is expressed by primary human breast cancer with a high risk for developing lung metastasis. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the LMS promotes primary tumor growth that enriches for LMS+ cells, and it allows for intravasation after reaching a critical tumor size. Clinically, this corresponds to LMS+ tumors being larger at diagnosis compared with LMS- tumors and to a marked rise in the incidence of metastasis after LMS+ tumors reach 2 cm. Patients with LMS-expressing primary tumors selectively fail in the lung compared with the bone or other visceral sites and have a worse overall survival. The mechanistic linkage between metastasis gene expression, accelerated tumor growth, and likelihood of metastatic recurrence provided by the LMS may help to explain observations of prognostic gene signatures in primary cancer and how tumor growth can both lead to metastasis and be a marker for cells destined to metastasize.

@article{chang2005robustness,
	Abstract = {Based on the hypothesis that features of the molecular program of normal wound healing might play an important role in cancer metastasis, we previously identified consistent features in the transcriptional response of normal fibroblasts to serum, and used this "wound-response signature" to reveal links between wound healing and cancer progression in a variety of common epithelial tumors. Here, in a consecutive series of 295 early breast cancer patients, we show that both overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival are markedly diminished in patients whose tumors expressed this wound-response signature compared to tumors that did not express this signature. A gene expression centroid of the wound-response signature provides a basis for prospectively assigning a prognostic score that can be scaled to suit different clinical purposes. The wound-response signature improves risk stratification independently of known clinico-pathologic risk factors and previously established prognostic signatures based on unsupervised hierarchical clustering ("molecular subtypes") or supervised predictors of metastasis ("70-gene prognosis signature").

@article{yu2004molecular,
	Abstract = {The Nottingham prognostic index (NPI) is a widely used clinicopathological staging system for breast cancer prognostication. Using a step-wise classification approach where breast tumor expression profiles were first divided into general "molecular subtypes" [estrogen receptor (ER)+, ER-, ERBB2+], followed by an independent analysis of each subtype, we identified a 62-gene expression signature (NPI-ES) highly correlated to the NPI in ER+ tumors. The NPI-ES classified the majority of ER+ tumors into two distinct groups with high confidence and was significantly correlated to NPI status in two independent sets of ER+ tumors derived from different centers. The NPI-ES is comparable to the classical NPI in identifying patients likely to exhibit a poor clinical prognosis, as well as to a recently described "prognosis signature" for breast cancer. Our findings demonstrate how expression profiling can complement classical staging systems employing histopathological parameters scored over a continuous range of values.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Published prognostic gene signatures in breast cancer have few genes in common. Here we provide a rationale for this observation by studying the prognostic power and the underlying biological pathways of different gene signatures.METHODS:Gene signatures to predict the development of metastases in estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative tumors were identified using 500 re-sampled training sets and mapping to Gene Ontology Biological Process to identify over-represented pathways. The Global Test program confirmed that gene expression profilings in the common pathways were associated with the metastasis of the patients.RESULTS:The apoptotic pathway and cell division, or cell growth regulation and G-protein coupled receptor signal transduction, were most significantly associated with the metastatic capability of estrogen receptor-positive or estrogen-negative tumors, respectively. A gene signature derived of the common pathways predicted metastasis in an independent cohort. Mapping of the pathways represented by different published prognostic signatures showed that they share 53% of the identified pathways.CONCLUSION:We show that divergent gene sets classifying patients for the same clinical endpoint represent similar biological processes and that pathway-derived signatures can be used to predict prognosis. Furthermore, our study reveals that the underlying biology related to aggressiveness of estrogen receptor subgroups of breast cancer is quite different.},

	<title>Purpose</title>
	<p>Optimal management of breast ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (DCIS) is controversial, and many patients are still overtreated. The local death of myoepithelial cells (MECs) is believed to be a pre-requisite to tumor invasion. We thus hypothesized that loss of CD10 expression, a MEC surface peptidase, would signify basement membrane disruption and confer increased risk of relapse in DCIS. The aim of our study was to retrospectively evaluate the prognostic value of CD10 in DCIS.</p>
	</sec><sec>
	<title>Experimental Design</title>
	<p>CD10 expression was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry using paraffin-embedded samples of normal breast tissue (n = 11); of morphologically normal ducts associated with DCIS (n = 10); and of DCIS without an invasive component (n = 154).</p>
	</sec><sec>
	<title>Results</title>
	<p>CD10 immunostaining was only observed in MECs in normal tissue and in DCIS. Normal tissue showed high mRNA expression levels of CD10, whereas DCIS showed a variable range. After a median follow-up of 6 years, DCIS with CD10 expression below the levels observed in normal tissue (71%) demonstrated a higher risk of local relapse (HR = 1.88; [95CI:1.30--2.70], p = 0.001) in univariate analysis. No relapse was observed in patients expressing high CD10 mRNA levels (29%) similar to the ones observed in normal tissue. In multivariate analysis including known prognostic factors, low CD10 mRNA expression remained significant (HR = 2.25; [95%CI:1.24--4.09], p = 0.008), as did the recently revised Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI) score (HR = 2.03; [95%CI:1.23--3.35], p = 0.006).</p>
	</sec><sec>
	<title>Conclusion</title>
	<p>The decrease of CD10 expression in MECs is associated with a higher risk of relapse in DCIS; this knowledge has the potential to improve DCIS management.</p>

		Abstract = { mutations are reported to be present in approximately 25% of breast cancer (BC), particularly the estrogen receptor--positive (ER+) and HER2-overexpressing (HER2+) subtypes, making them one of the most common genetic aberrations in BC. In experimental models, these mutations have been shown to activate  and induce oncogenic transformation, and hence these lesions have been hypothesized to render tumors highly sensitive to therapeutic PI3K/mTOR inhibition. By analyzing gene expression and protein data from nearly 1,800 human BCs, we report that a  mutation--associated gene signature (-GS) derived from exon 20 (kinase domain) mutations was able to predict  mutation status in two independent datasets, strongly suggesting a characteristic set of gene expression--induced changes. However, in ER+/HER2− BC despite pathway activation,  mutations were associated with a phenotype of relatively low mTORC1 signaling and a good prognosis with tamoxifen monotherapy. The relationship between clinical outcome and the -GS was also assessed. Although the -GS was not associated with prognosis in ER− and HER2+ BC, it could identify better clinical outcomes in ER+/HER2− disease. In ER+ BC cell lines,  mutations were also associated with sensitivity to tamoxifen. These findings could have important implications for the treatment of -mutant BCs and the development of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.

		Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Within estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (ER+ BC), the expression levels of proliferation-related genes can define two clinically distinct molecular subtypes. When treated with adjuvant tamoxifen, those ER+ BCs that are lowly proliferative have a good prognosis (luminal-A subtype), however the clinical outcome of those that are highly proliferative is poor (luminal-B subtype).METHODS:To investigate the biological basis for these observations, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using microarray data from 246 ER+ BC samples from women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy. To create an in vitro model of growth factor (GF) signaling activation, MCF-7 cells were treated with heregulin (HRG), an HER3 ligand.RESULTS:We found that a gene set linked to GF signaling was significantly enriched in the luminal-B tumors, despite only 10% of samples over-expressing HER2 by immunohistochemistry. To determine the biological significance of this observation, MCF-7 cells were treated with HRG. These cells displayed phosphorylation of HER2/3 and downstream ERK and S6. Treatment with HRG overcame tamoxifen-induced cell cycle arrest with higher S-phase fraction and increased anchorage independent colony formation. Gene expression profiles of MCF-7 cells treated with HRG confirmed enrichment of the GF signaling gene set and a similar proliferative signature observed in human ER+ BCs resistant to tamoxifen.CONCLUSION:These data demonstrate that activation of GF signaling pathways, independent of HER2 over-expression, could be contributing to the poor prognosis of the luminal-B ER+ BC subtype.},

		Abstract = {The clonal CD3-CD4+ T cell population characterizing lymphocytic variant hypereosinophilic syndrome (L-HES) persists for years, with a subgroup of patients ultimately progressing to T lymphoma. The molecular changes associated with the persistence of the pre-malignant clone and the emergence of malignant subclones are unknown, precluding the development of targeted therapy for this HES variant. In this study, we used whole genome arrays, flow cytometry and qRT-PCR to examine gene expression in the CD3-CD4+ T cells and found that 850 genes were differentially regulated during chronic disease compared with CD3+CD4+ T cells from healthy donors. Changes in the expression of 349 genes were altered in association with the clinical progression from chronic L-HES to T lymphoma in one patient, with 87/349 genes representing further changes in genes whose expression was altered in all chronic disease patients (87/850). Array analysis after CD2/CD28-mediated activation revealed that the major gene expression changes observed in the CD3-CD4+ T cells do not reflect activation induced alterations but rather pathways involved in T cell homeostasis, including TGF{beta} signaling, apoptosis and T cell maturation, signaling and migration. microRNA expression in the CD3-CD4+ T cells from patients with chronic disease was examined using qRT-PCR and identified 23 microRNAs that changed significantly, among which miR-125a further decreased in association with one patient's evolution to T lymphoma.

		Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Proliferation and tumor differentiation captured by the genomic grade index (GGI) are important prognostic indicators in breast cancer (BC) especially for the estrogen receptor positive (ER+) disease. The aims of this study were to convert this microarray index to a qRT-PCR assay (PCR-GGI), which could be realized on formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples (FFPE), and to assess its prognostic performance and predictive value of clinical benefit in early and advanced ER+ BC patients treated with tamoxifen. METHODS:The accuracy and concordance of the PCR-GGI with the GGI was assessed using BC patients for which frozen and FFPE tissues as well as microarray data were available (n=19). The evaluation of the prognostic value of the PCR-GGI was assessed on FFPE material using a consecutive series of 212 systemically treated early BC patients. The predictive performance for tamoxifen benefit was assessed using two ER+ BC populations treated either with adjuvant tamoxifen only (n=77+139) or first-line tamoxifen for advanced disease (n=270). RESULTS:The PCR-GGI is based on the expression of 8 genes (4 representative of the GGI genes and 4 reference genes). A significant correlation was observed between the microarray-derived GGI and the qRT-PCR assay using frozen (rho=0.95, p<10E-06) and FFPE material (rho=0.89, p<10E-06). The prognostic performance of the PCR-GGI was confirmed on FFPE samples (HRunivar.=1.89; [95CI:1.01-3.54], p=0.05). The PCR-GGI further identified two subgroups of patients with statistically different time to distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) across the two cohorts of ER+ BC patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. Additionally, the PCR-GGI was associated with response to tamoxifen in the advanced setting (HRunivar.=1.98; [95CI:1.51-2.59], p=6.9E-07). CONCLUSIONS:PCR-GGI recapitulates in an accurate and reproducible manner the performances of the GGI using frozen and FFPE samples.

		Abstract = {BackgroundZeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP70) is a widely recognized prognostic factor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but mechanisms by which its higher expression leads to a poor outcome must still be fully explained.  Design and MethodsIn an attempt to unveil unfavorable cellular properties linked to high ZAP70 expression, we used gene expression profiling to identify genes associated with disparities in B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients expressing high versus low ZAP70 mRNA, measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Two groups of 7 patients were compared, selected on the basis of either high or low ZAP70 mRNA expression.  ResultsTwenty-seven genes were differentially expressed with an FDR<10%, and several genes were significant predictors of treatment-free survival (TFS) and/or overall survival; PDE8A and FCRL family genes (down-regulated in ZAP70+ patients) could predict TFS and overall survival; ITGA4 mRNA (up-regulated in ZAP70+ patients) could significantly predict overall survival. Importantly, gene set enrichment analysis revealed overrepresentation of adhesion/migration genes. We therefore investigated in vitro adhesion/migration capacity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells into a stromal microenvironment or in response to conditioned medium. We showed that ZAP70+ cells had better adhesion/migration capacities and only ZAP70+ patient cells responded to microenvironment contact by CXCR4 downregulation.  ConclusionsWe concluded that several prognostic factors are the reflection of microenvironment interactions and that the increased adhesion/migratory capacity of ZAP70+ cells in their microenvironment can explain their better survival and thus the aggressiveness of the disease.

		Abstract = {533  Background: The phosphathidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in tumor biology and is an attractive target for cancer therapy. Our aim was to characterize the molecular and clinical outcome effects of PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer (BC). Methods: We analyzed 173 BC samples for PIK3CA mutations. Corresponding gene expression profiles were used to understand its effects on the PI3K pathway. We validated a PIK3CA-GS in 2 independent BC cohorts (n = 183) with known PIK3CA mutation status and evaluated its correlation with clinical outcome in 1748 BC samples stratified by treatment and subtype. Results: 26% of BCs had a PIK3CA mutation. Tumors with PIK3CA mutation demonstrated a distinct gene expression signature (p = 0.03 after 1000 perm). In 2 datasets it could discriminate PIK3CA mutation carriers from wild-type (ROC 0.68, 0.71, p = 0.001for both). However, the PIK3CA-GS was correlated with deactivation of the PI3K pathway probably through a negative feedback loop. This observation was supported by: 1) the PIK3CA-GS was significantly correlated with gene expression changes induced by PI3K inhibitors (Connectivity Map, Gene set enrichment analyses) and 2) the PIK3CA-GS was anti-correlated with a GS of PTEN loss (R = -0.3; Saal et al, 2007). Higher levels of the PIK3CA signature were observed in HER-2+ and estrogen receptor positive (ER+), luminal BC subtypes. Whilst there was no association with mutation status alone and prognosis, increasing expression of the PIK3CA-GS (suggesting deactivation) was significantly associated with better clinical outcome in both untreated (p = 0.04) and particularly ER+, luminal-B, tamoxifen only-treated (p = 0.004) BC. Multivariate analysis (HR: 0.4; 95%CI: 0.3-0.7; p = 0.002) confirmed that the PI3KCA-GS provided independent prognostic information. Conclusions: Paradoxically, the PIK3CA-GS correlates with inhibition of the PI3K pathway in ER+ BC and identifies a subgroup of luminal B BCs with a favorable outcome. The PIK3CA-GS may be a better indicator of PI3K pathway dysfunction than mutation status, potentially indicating patients who may benefit from combined endocrine therapy and PI3K inhibition.  No significant financial relationships to disclose.

		Abstract = {Aberrant expression of microRNAs has been recently associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) outcome. Although disease evolution can be predicted by several prognostic factors, a better outcome individualization in a given patient is still of utmost interest. Here, we showed that miR-29c and miR-223 expression levels decreased significantly with progression from Binet stage A to C were significantly lower in poor prognostic subgroups (defined by several prognostic factors) and could significantly predict treatment-free survival (TFS) and overall survival (OS). Furthermore, we developed a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) score combining miR-29c, miR-223, ZAP70, and LPL (from 0 to 4 poor prognostic markers) to stratify treatment and death risk in a cohort of 110 patients with a median follow-up of 72 months (range, 2-312). Patients with a score of 0/4, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4 had a median TFS of greater than 312, of 129, 80, 36, and 19 months, respectively (hazard ratio, HR0/4 < 1/4 < 2/4 < 3/4 < 4/4 = 17.00, P < .001). Patients with a score of 0-1/4, 2-3/4, and 4/4 had a median OS of greater than 312, of 183 and 106 months, respectively (HR0/4 < 1/4 < 2/4 < 3/4 < 4/4 = 13.69, P = .001). This score will help to identify, among the good and poor prognosis subgroups, patients who will need early therapy and thus will require a closer follow-up.

		Abstract = {BACKGROUND:We have previously shown that the Gene expression Grade Index (GGI) was able to identify two subtypes of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors that were associated with statistically distinct clinical outcomes in both untreated and tamoxifen-treated patients. Here, we aim to investigate the ability of the GGI to predict relapses in postmenopausal women who were treated with tamoxifen (T) or letrozole (L) within the BIG 1-98 trial. METHODS:We generated gene expression profiles (Affymetrix) and computed the GGI for a matched, case-control sample of patients enrolled in the BIG 1-98 trial from the two hospitals where frozen samples were available. All relapses (cases) were identified from patients randomized to receive monotherapy or from the switching treatment arms for whom relapse occurred before the switch.  Each case was randomly matched with four controls based upon nodal status and treatment (T or L).  The prognostic value of GGI was assessed as a continuous predictor and divided at the median.  Predictive accuracy of GGI was estimated using time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curves. RESULTS:Frozen samples were analyzable for 48 patients (10 cases and 38 controls).  Seven of the 10 cases had been assigned to receive L. Cases and controls were comparable with respect to menopausal and nodal status, local and chemotherapy, and HER2 positivity. Cases were slightly older than controls and had a larger proportion of large, poorly differentiated ER+/PgR- tumors.  The GGI was significantly and linearly related to risk of relapse: each 10-unit increase in GGI resulted in an increase of approximately 11% in the hazard rate (p=0.02).  Within the subgroups of patients with node-positive disease or who were treated with L, the hazard of relapse was significantly greater for patients with GGI at or above the median. AUC reached a maximum of 78% at 27 months.CONCLUSIONS:This analysis supports the GGI as a good predictor of relapse for ER-positive patients, even among patients who receive L.  Validation of these results, in a larger series from BIG 1-98, is planned using the simplified GGI represented by a smaller set of genes and tested by qRT-PCR on paraffin-embedded tissues. },

Pathologic response was quantified using the residual cancer burden (RCB) method. The association between the GGI and pathologic response was assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses. The performance of a response predictor combining clinical variables and GGI was evaluated under cross-validation.  ResultsEighty-five percent of grade 1 tumors had low GGI, 89% of grade 3 tumors had high GGI, and 63% of grade 2 tumors had low GGI. Among both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and -negative cancers, high GGI score was associated with pathologic complete response (RCB-0) or minimal residual disease (RCB-1). A multivariate model combining GGI and clinical parameters had an overall accuracy of 71%, compared with 58% for the GGI alone, for prediction of pathologic response. However, high GGI score was also associated with significantly worse distant relapse-free survival in patients with ER-positive cancer (P = .005), and was not associated with survival in patients with ER-negative cancer.  ConclusionHigh GGI is associated with increased sensitivity to neoadjuvant paclitaxel plus fluorouracil, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in both ER-negative and ER-positive patients, but it remains a predictor of worse survival in ER-positive patients.

		Abstract = {We have previously reported that galectin 1 (Gal-1) plays important biological roles in astroglial as well as in oligodendroglial cancer cells. As an oligodendroglioma model, we make use of the Hs683 cell line that has been previously extensively characterized at cell biology, molecular biology, and genetic levels. Galectin 1 has been shown to be involved in Hs683 oligodendroglioma chemoresistance, neoangiogenesis, and migration. Down-regulating Gal-1 expression in Hs683 cells through targeted small interfering RNA provokes a marked decrease in the expression of the brain-expressed X-linked gene: BEX2. Accordingly, the potential role of BEX2 in Hs683 oligodendroglioma cell biology has been investigated. The data presented here reveal that decreasing BEX2 expression in Hs683 cells increases the survival of Hs683 orthotopic xenograft-bearing mice. Furthermore, this decrease in BEX2 expression impairs vasculogenic mimicry channel formation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo, and modulates glioma cell adhesion and invasive features through the modification of several genes previously reported to play a role in cancer cell migration, including MAP2, plexin C1, SWAP70, and integrin beta(6). We thus conclude that BEX2 is implicated in oligodendroglioma biology.},

		Abstract = {Motivation: Survival prediction of breast cancer (BC) patients independently of treatment, also known as prognostication, is a complex task since clinically similar breast tumors, in addition to be molecularly heterogeneous, may exhibit different clinical outcomes. In recent years, the analysis of gene expression profiles by means of sophisticated data mining tools emerged as a promising technology to bring additional insights into BC biology and to improve the quality of prognostication. The aim of this work is to assess quantitatively the accuracy of prediction obtained with state-of-the-art data analysis techniques for BC microarray data through an independent and thorough framework.  Results: Due to the large number of variables, the reduced amount of samples and the high degree of noise, complex prediction methods are highly exposed to performance degradation despite the use of cross-validation techniques. Our analysis shows that the most complex methods are not significantly better than the simplest one, a univariate model relying on a single proliferation gene. This result suggests that proliferation might be the most relevant biological process for BC prognostication and that the loss of interpretability deriving from the use of overcomplex methods may be not sufficiently counterbalanced by an improvement of the quality of prediction.

		Abstract = {BACKGROUND:During the last years, several groups have identified prognostic gene expression signatures with apparently similar performances. However, signatures were never compared on an independent population of untreated breast cancer patients, where risk assessment was computed using the original algorithms and microarray platforms.RESULTS:We compared three gene expression signatures, the 70-gene, the 76-gene and the Gene expression Grade Index (GGI) signatures, in terms of predicting distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) for the individual patient. To this end, we used the previously published TRANSBIG independent validation series of node-negative untreated primary breast cancer patients. We observed agreement in prediction for 135 of 198 patients (68%) when considering the three signatures. When comparing the signatures two by two, the agreement in prediction was 71% for the 70- and 76-gene signatures, 76% for the 76-gene signature and the GGI, and 88% for the 70-gene signature and the GGI. The three signatures had similar capabilities of predicting DMFS and added significant prognostic information to that provided by the classical parameters.CONCLUSION:Despite the difference in development of these signatures and the limited overlap in gene identity, they showed similar prognostic performance, adding to the growing evidence that these prognostic signatures are of clinical relevance.},

		Abstract = {INTRODUCTION:Breast cancer subtyping and prognosis have been studied extensively by gene expression profiling, resulting in disparate signatures with little overlap in their constituent genes. Although a previous study demonstrated a prognostic concordance among gene expression signatures, it was limited to only one dataset and did not fully elucidate how the different genes were related to one another nor did it examine the contribution of well-known biological processes of breast cancer tumorigenesis to their prognostic performance.METHOD:To address the above issues and to further validate these initial findings, we performed the largest meta-analysis of publicly available breast cancer gene expression and clinical data, which are comprised of 2,833 breast tumors. Gene coexpression modules of three key biological processes in breast cancer (namely, proliferation, estrogen receptor [ER], and HER2 signaling) were used to dissect the role of constituent genes of nine prognostic signatures.RESULTS:Using a meta-analytical approach, we consolidated the signatures associated with ER signaling, ERBB2 amplification, and proliferation. Previously published expression-based nomenclature of breast cancer 'intrinsic' subtypes can be mapped to the three modules, namely, the ER-/HER2- (basal-like), the HER2+ (HER2-like), and the low- and high-proliferation ER+/HER2- subtypes (luminal A and B). We showed that all nine prognostic signatures exhibited a similar prognostic performance in the entire dataset. Their prognostic abilities are due mostly to the detection of proliferation activity. Although ER- status (basal-like) and ERBB2+ expression status correspond to bad outcome, they seem to act through elevated expression of proliferation genes and thus contain only indirect information about prognosis. Clinical variables measuring the extent of tumor progression, such as tumor size and nodal status, still add independent prognostic information to proliferation genes.CONCLUSION:This meta-analysis unifies various results of previous gene expression studies in breast cancer. It reveals connections between traditional prognostic factors, expression-based subtyping, and prognostic signatures, highlighting the important role of proliferation in breast cancer prognosis.},

		Abstract = {509  Background: The majority of early-stage BC express estrogen receptors (ER) and receive tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting. Yet up to 40% of these patients will relapse on tamoxifen and develop incurable metastatic disease. Recent evidence from three large randomised controlled trials exploring the role of AI in the adjuvant setting shows a benefit from the novel strategy, however the optimal sequence and duration of AI/tamoxifen treatment is unknown. Therefore, it is vital that we learn to identify those women at higher risk of tamoxifen resistance. Our aim was to identify genes that could predict for this subset of women. Methods: We determined the gene expression profiles from 105 tamoxifen-only treated ER positive early stage BC (training set) using Affymetrix U133 A and B chips. Within this group, 30 (29%) patients developed distant recurrence at a median time to relapse of 3.8 years (yrs) and 75 (71%) remained disease free at a median of 5.7 yrs of follow-up. The independent validation set consisted of 64 ER+ tamoxifen only treated BC patients (17 recurrences) from a different institution (Karolinska, Sweden). Results: Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified 50 genes that were significantly associated with distant relapse on tamoxifen. The probability of selecting these genes by chance was estimated to be p=0.001 after 1000 random permutations. These genes were powerful predictors of clinical outcome in the independent validation set, dividing the cohort into 2 statistically different prognostic groups (p=0.02) in the poor prognostic group (tamoxifen resistant) the median time to distant relapse was 2.4yrs compared with 7yrs in the good prognostic one (tamoxifen sensitive). We are currently validating this signature in another independent dataset (Guys hospital, UK). Conclusions: These results suggest that a group of genes can identify BC patients at risk of early distant relapse on tamoxifen. These patients could be the ideal candidates for upfront AIs, while the others would be considered for sequential tamoxifen/AI. This hypothesis will be tested in an upcoming prospective clinical trial "MINDACT".

		Abstract = {Background: Histologic grade in breast cancer provides clinically important prognostic information. However, 30%-60% of tumors are classified as histologic grade 2. This grade is associated with an intermediate risk of recurrence and is thus not informative for clinical decision making. We examined whether histologic grade was associated with gene expression profiles of breast cancers and whether such profiles could be used to improve histologic grading. Methods: We analyzed microarray data from 189 invasive breast carcinomas and from three published gene expression datasets from breast carcinomas. We identified differentially expressed genes in a training set of 64 estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumor samples by comparing expression profiles between histologic grade 3 tumors and histologic grade 1 tumors and used the expression of these genes to define the gene expression grade index. Data from 597 independent tumors were used to evaluate the association between relapse-free survival and the gene expression grade index in a Kaplan-Meier analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: We identified 97 genes in our training set that were associated with histologic grade; most of these genes were involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. In validation datasets, the gene expression grade index was strongly associated with histologic grade 1 and 3 status; however, among histologic grade 2 tumors, the index spanned the values for histologic grade 1-3 tumors. Among patients with histologic grade 2 tumors, a high gene expression grade index was associated with a higher risk of recurrence than a low gene expression grade index (hazard ratio = 3.61, 95% confidence interval = 2.25 to 5.78; P<.001, log-rank test). Conclusions: Gene expression grade index appeared to reclassify patients with histologic grade 2 tumors into two groups with high versus low risks of recurrence. This approach may improve the accuracy of tumor grading and thus its prognostic value.

		Abstract = {PurposeA number of microarray studies have reported distinct molecular profiles of breast cancers (BC), such as basal-like, ErbB2-like, and two to three luminal-like subtypes. These were associated with different clinical outcomes. However, although the basal and the ErbB2 subtypes are repeatedly recognized, identification of estrogen receptor (ER) -positive subtypes has been inconsistent. Therefore, refinement of their molecular definition is needed.  Materials and MethodsWe have previously reported a gene expression grade index (GGI), which defines histologic grade based on gene expression profiles. Using this algorithm, we assigned ER-positive BC to either high-or low-genomic grade subgroups and compared these with previously reported ER-positive molecular classifications. As further validation, we classified 666 ER-positive samples into subtypes and assessed their clinical outcome.  ResultsTwo ER-positive molecular subgroups (high and low genomic grade) could be defined using the GGI. Despite tracking a single biologic pathway, these were highly comparable to the previously described luminal A and B classification and significantly correlated to the risk groups produced using the 21-gene recurrence score. The two subtypes were associated with statistically distinct clinical outcome in both systemically untreated and tamoxifen-treated populations.  ConclusionThe use of genomic grade can identify two clinically distinct ER-positive molecular subtypes in a simple and highly reproducible manner across multiple data sets. This study emphasizes the important role of proliferation-related genes in predicting prognosis in ER-positive BC.

		Abstract = {Purpose: Recently, a 76-gene prognostic signature able to predict distant metastases in lymph node-negative (N-) breast cancer patients was reported. The aims of this study conducted by TRANSBIG were to independently validate these results and to compare the outcome with clinical risk assessment.  Experimental Design: Gene expression profiling of frozen samples from 198 N- systemically untreated patients was done at the Bordet Institute, blinded to clinical data and independent of Veridex. Genomic risk was defined by Veridex, blinded to clinical data. Survival analyses, done by an independent statistician, were done with the genomic risk and adjusted for the clinical risk, defined by Adjuvant! Online.  Results: The actual 5- and 10-year time to distant metastasis were 98% (88-100%) and 94% (83-98%), respectively, for the good profile group and 76% (68-82%) and 73% (65-79%), respectively, for the poor profile group. The actual 5- and 10-year overall survival were 98% (88-100%) and 87% (73-94%), respectively, for the good profile group and 84% (77-89%) and 72% (63-78%), respectively, for the poor profile group. We observed a strong time dependence of this signature, leading to an adjusted hazard ratio of 13.58 (1.85-99.63) and 8.20 (1.10-60.90) at 5 years and 5.11 (1.57-16.67) and 2.55 (1.07-6.10) at 10 years for time to distant metastasis and overall survival, respectively.  Conclusion: This independent validation confirmed the performance of the 76-gene signature and adds to the growing evidence that gene expression signatures are of clinical relevance, especially for identifying patients at high risk of early distant metastases.

		Abstract = {Purpose: Recently, several prognostic gene expression signatures have been identified; however, their performance has never been evaluated according to the previously described molecular subtypes based on the estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and their biological meaning has remained unclear. Here we aimed to perform a comprehensive meta-analysis integrating both clinicopathologic and gene expression data, focusing on the main molecular subtypes.  Experimental Design: We developed gene expression modules related to key biological processes in breast cancer such as tumor invasion, immune response, angiogenesis, apoptosis, proliferation, and ER and HER2 signaling, and then analyzed these modules together with clinical variables and several prognostic signatures on publicly available microarray studies (>2,100 patients).  Results: Multivariate analysis showed that in the ER+/HER2- subgroup, only the proliferation module and the histologic grade were significantly associated with clinical outcome. In the ER-/HER2- subgroup, only the immune response module was associated with prognosis, whereas in the HER2+ tumors, the tumor invasion and immune response modules displayed significant association with survival. Proliferation was identified as the most important component of several prognostic signatures, and their performance was limited to the ER+/HER2- subgroup.  Conclusions: Although proliferation is the strongest parameter predicting clinical outcome in the ER+/HER2- subtype and the common denominator of most prognostic gene signatures, immune response and tumor invasion seem to be the main molecular processes associated with prognosis in the ER-/HER2- and HER2+ subgroups, respectively. These findings may help to define new clinicogenomic models and to identify new therapeutic strategies in the specific molecular subgroups.

		Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers (BC) are heterogeneous with regard to their clinical behavior and response to therapies. The ER is currently the best predictor of response to the anti-estrogen agent tamoxifen, yet up to 30-40% of ER+BC will relapse despite tamoxifen treatment. New prognostic biomarkers and further biological understanding of tamoxifen resistance are required. We used gene expression profiling to develop an outcome-based predictor using a training set of 255 ER+ BC samples from women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy. We used clusters of highly correlated genes to develop our predictor to facilitate both signature stability and biological interpretation. Independent validation was performed using 362 tamoxifen-treated ER+ BC samples obtained from multiple institutions and treated with tamoxifen only in the adjuvant and metastatic settings.RESULTS:We developed a gene classifier consisting of 181 genes belonging to 13 biological clusters. In the independent set of adjuvantly-treated samples, it was able to define two distinct prognostic groups (HR 2.01 95%CI: 1.29-3.13; p = 0.002). Six of the 13 gene clusters represented pathways involved in cell cycle and proliferation. In 112 metastatic breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen, one of the classifier components suggesting a cellular inflammatory mechanism was significantly predictive of response.CONCLUSION:We have developed a gene classifier that can predict clinical outcome in tamoxifen-treated ER+ BC patients. Whilst our study emphasizes the important role of proliferation genes in prognosis, our approach proposes other genes and pathways that may elucidate further mechanisms that influence clinical outcome and prediction of response to tamoxifen.},

	@article{mijatovic2008nucleolus,
		Abstract = {The use of cardenolides like ouabain, digitoxin, or oleandrin has been reported previously many times as a means of potentially combating human refractory prostate cancer by inducing apoptosis through an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations. The aims of the current study were to investigate if part of the antitumor effects mediated by cardenolides concerned disorganization of nucleolar structure and whether this was further associated with a marked decrease in c-Myc expression. Accordingly, the antitumor activity of a novel hemisynthetic cardenolide [1R,3aS,3bR,5aS,6aR,7aS,9R,12aR,13aR,15aR]-3a,11a-dihydroxy-13a-(hydroxymethyl)-9,15a-dimethyl-1-(5-oxo-2,5-dihydrofuran-3-yl)icosahydro-1H,4'H-spiro[cyclopenta [7,8]phenanthro[2,3-b]pyrano[3,2-e][1,4]dioxine-11,2'-[1,3]thiazolidin]-4'-one (UNBS1450)] was compared with that of classic cardenolides and reference anticancer agents in prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo following s.c. and orthotopic prostate cancer cell grafting into mice. The present study indicates that UNBS1450 markedly decreases the in vitro viability/proliferation of human prostate cancer cell lines but not of normal cells. The induced effects are not linked to an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Rather, they appear to relate to the compound's capacity to disorganize nucleolar structure and function (through an impairment of cyclin-dependent kinase and c-Myc expression and related signaling pathways; paralleled by the disorganization of cancer cell-specific perinucleolar bodies as revealed by disruption of Sam68). This nonapoptotic cancer cell death mediated by severe nucleolar targeting and down-regulation of c-Myc expression is a completely new cardenolide-induced mechanism of antitumor action.

		Abstract = {Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is heterogeneous with respect to prognosis and clinical outcome. The mutational status of the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain region (IGHV) has been used to classify patients into 2 groups in terms of overall survival (OS) and clinical characteristics, but the labor-intensive nature and the cost of this time-consuming analysis has prompted investigations of surrogate markers.  Methods: We developed a standardized quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) method to measure zeta-chain (TCR)-associated protein kinase (ZAP70) mRNA in purified CD19+ cells. We evaluated this and other methods (flow cytometry analyses of ZAP70 and CD38 proteins and qPCR analysis of lipoprotein lipase mRNA) in a cohort of 108 patients (median follow-up, 82 months) to evaluate any associations with IGHV mutational status, OS, and treatment-free survival (TFS).  Results: The association between qPCR-measured ZAP70 and IGHV mutational status was statistically significant [{chi}2 (1) = 50.95; P <0.0001], and the value of Cramer's V statistic (0.72) indicated a very strong relation. This method also demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 87.8%, 85.7%, 87.5%, and 86%, respectively. ZAP70 expression was significantly associated with OS (P = 0.0021) and TFS (P <0.0001). ZAP70+ patients had significantly shorter median TFS (24 months) than ZAP70- patients (157 months) (P <0.0001). Moreover, qPCR-measured ZAP70 expression has greater prognostic power than IGHV mutational status and the other prognostic markers tested.  Conclusions: ZAP70 mRNA quantification via qPCR is a strong surrogate marker of IGHV mutational status and a powerful prognostic factor.
